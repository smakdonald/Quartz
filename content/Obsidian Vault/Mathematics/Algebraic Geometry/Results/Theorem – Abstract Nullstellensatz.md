#### Theorem â€“ Abstract Nullstellensatz
For any field $k$ and integer $n\leq0$, if $m$ is any maximal ideal of the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, then the canonical map $k\to k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/m$ (given as the composition of the inclusion of k into $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ followed by the canonical quotient map) is a finite extension of fields.
