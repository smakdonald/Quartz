#### $\prop$ – Dim of AV Equal to Dim of Coord. Ring
The [[Dim (Noetherian Top Space)|dimension]] of an [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $X$ is equal to the [[Krull Dimension of a Ring|Krull dimension]] of its [[Coordinate Ring|coordinate ring]] $A(X).$

##### *Proof.*
The result follows from the fact that there is an order-reversing bijections between [[Prime Ideal|prime ideals]] of $A(X)$ and [[Irreducible Affine Variety|irreducible]] closed subsets of $X$[^1]
