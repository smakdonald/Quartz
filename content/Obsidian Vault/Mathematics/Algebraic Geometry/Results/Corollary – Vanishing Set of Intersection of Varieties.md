#### $\cor$ â€“ Vanishing Set of Intersection of Varieties
If $k$ is algebraically closed and $W$ and $W'$ are two affine varieties in $\A^n_k$, then $I(W \cap W') = \sqrt{I(W) + I(W')}$.

##### *Proof.*
Since both sides are radical ideals, by the Nullstellensatz it suffices to prove $$V(I(W \cap W')) = V (\sqrt{I(W) + I(W')}).$$This holds since $V(I(W \cap W')) = W \cap W'$ and $$V (\sqrt{I(W) + I(W')}) = V(I(W) + I(W')) = V(I(W)) \cap V(I(W')) = W \cap W'$$
