#### Proposition â€“ Compositions of Vanishing Sets and Zero Loci
For any field $k$ the following hold:
(a) Given a [[Radical Ideal|radical]] ideal $J$ of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$[^1] we have[^2] $$I(V (J))\supseteq J.$$(This holds in fact for any subset $J$.)
(b) Given an [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $W$ in $\A^n_k$ we have $$V(I(V))\supseteq W$$(This holds in fact for any subset $W$.)

##### *Proof.*
If $f \in J$, then for each $P \in V(J)$ we have, by definition, that $f(P) = 0$ and hence, again by definition, $f \in I(V(J))$. Note that this remains valid if $J$ is any subset. For the second one, pick $P \in W$. For any $f \in I(W)$ we have, by definition, $f(P) = 0$. Again by definition this means $P \in V(I(W))$. Note that this containment holds if $W$ is any subset.
