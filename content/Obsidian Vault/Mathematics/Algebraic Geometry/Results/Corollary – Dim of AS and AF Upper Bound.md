#### $\cor$ – Dim of AS and AF Upper Bound
The [[Dim (Noetherian Top Space)|dimension]] of $\A^n_k$[^1] is $n$ and the dimension of any [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] in $\A^n_k$ is at most $n$.

##### *Proof.*
This holds since the [[Krull Dimension of a Ring|Krull dimension]] of $k[\xdots]$[^2] is $n$,[^3] a fact we will not prove in this class.

[^1]: Notation: [[Affine Space]]
[^2]: Notation: [[Polynomial Ring]]
[^3]: But we have proved it here: [[Corollary – Dimension of Polynomial Ring]]
