#### $\cor$ – AV Finite Union of Irreducible Closed Subsets
Every [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $X$ is a finite union of [[Irreducible Affine Variety|irreducible]] closed subsets, $X = X_1 \cup \cdots \cup X_m$, such that $X_i \not\subseteq X_j$ for all $i \ne j$. Moreover, the list of such subsets is unique up to ordering, and are known as the *irreducible components* of $X$.

##### *Proof.*
This holds since the ring $A(X)$ is [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]] and hence has a finite number of [[Minimal Prime|minimal primes]] $\fp_1 \dots, \fp_m$[^1] – we take $X_i = V(\fp_i)$.
