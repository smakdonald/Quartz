#### Corollary â€“ Weak Nullstellensatz
If $k$ is [[Algebraically Closed|algebraically closed]] and $J$ is a proper ideal of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$[^1], then $V(J)\neq\emptyset$[^2].

##### *Proof.*
Since $J$ is proper it is contained in some maximal ideal $\fm$. (As a technical point, this fact does not require Zorn's Lemma in this setting, since the ring $k[x_1, \dots,x_n]$ is noetherian.) So the result follows from the previous Corollary.
