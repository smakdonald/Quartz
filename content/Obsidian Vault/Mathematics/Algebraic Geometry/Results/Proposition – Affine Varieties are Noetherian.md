#### $\prop$ – Affine Varieties are Noetherian
Every [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $X$ is *noetherian* – by definition, this means the [[Poset and Lattice|poset]] of its closed subsets satisfies the dcc.

##### *Proof.*
This holds since $A(X)$ has the [[Ascending Chain Condition|acc]] on (radical) ideals and vanishing sets reverse inclusion.
