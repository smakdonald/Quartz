#### Corollary
For any field $k$, every [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $V$ in $\A^n_k$[^1] is the [[Zero Locus|zero locus]] of a finite list of polynomials.

##### *Proof.*
Let $k$ be a field. By this [[Proposition – Locus of a Set and Radical are Equal|Proposition]] we may assume $V=V(I)$ for a ([[Radical Ideal|radical]])[^2] ideal $I$. By the [[Theorem – Hilbert’s Basis Theorem|HBT]] we have $I =\langle g_1,\dots,g_m\rangle$ for some $g_{i}$'s[^3] and hence (using the Proposition again) $V=V(g_1,\dots,g_m).$

[^1]: Notation: [[Affine Space]]
[^2]: By the Proposition, since $V(I)=V(\sqrt{I})$  and $V(\sqrt{I})$ is itself an ideal, we may take $V=V(\sqrt{I})$, which is a radical ideal. 
[^3]: The Hilbert Basis Theorem tells us the [[Polynomial Ring|polynomial ring]] $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]], making $I$ finitely [[Generator|generated]].
