#### $\thm$ â€“ Properties of Dimension
Assume $k$ is [[Algebraically Closed|algebraically closed]] and $X$ and $Y$ are [[Irreducible Affine Variety|irreducible]] [[Affine Variety|affine]] $k$-varieties.
(a) We have $\dm(X \times Y) = \dm(X) + \dm(Y)$[^1] (see the problem set for the definition of $X \times Y$).
(b) (Catenary property) If $Y \subseteq X$ then $\dm(X) = \dm(Y) + \codim_X(Y)$[^2].
(c) (Krull's Theorem). If $f)$ is a non-zero, non-[[Unit|unit]] element of $A(X)$[^3] (i.e. $\emptyset \subsetneq V_X(f) \subsetneq X$), then every irreducible component of $V_X(f)$[^4] has [[Codimension|codimension]] $1$ in $X$ (or, equivalently thanks to (b), has dimension $\dm(X) - 1$). In particular, $\dm V_X(f) = \dm(X) - 1$.
