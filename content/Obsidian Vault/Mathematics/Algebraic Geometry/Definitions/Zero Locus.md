#### $\defn$ â€“ Zero Locus
Recall $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is the [[Polynomial Ring|ring of all polynomials]] in the $n$ variables $x_1,\dots,x_n$ having $k$ coefficients.  
For any subset $S$ of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, the *zero locus* of $S$, written $V(S)$, is the subset of $\A^n_k$[^1] giving the common zeroes of all the members of $S$; that is $$V(S):=\{(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in\A^{n}_k |f(a_1,\dots,a_n)=0,\text{ for all }f\in S\}\sse\A^n_k.$$When we need to indicate the ground [[Field|field]], we write $V_k(S)$ for $V(S)$. Also, given a finite list  
$f_1,\dots,f_{m}\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, by $V(f_{1},\dots,f_{m})$ we mean $V(\{f_1,\dots,f_m\})$.
