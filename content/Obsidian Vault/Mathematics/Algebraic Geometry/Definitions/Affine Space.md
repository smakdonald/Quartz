#### $\defn$ â€“ Affine $n$-Space
For an arbitrary [[Field|field]] $k$, the *affine* $n$-*space* over $k$, written $\A_k^n$, is the set of $n$-tuples of elements of $k$: $$\A^n_k = \{(a_1,\dots,a_n) |a_i \in k\}$$So, $\A^n_k$ is just $k^n$, but we avoid using the latter since $k^n$ is the usual notation of the standard $n$-[[Dim (Vector Space)|dimensional]] $k$-[[Vector Space|vector space]]. Affine space is not thought of as a vector space typically.
