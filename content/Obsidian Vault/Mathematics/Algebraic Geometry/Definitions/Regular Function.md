#### $\defn$ â€“ Regular Function
Let $X$ be an [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] in $\A^n_k$[^1] and $V \subseteq X$ is an open subset. A *regular function* on $V$ is a function $\alpha: V \to \A^1_k = k$ such that the following condition holds: 

For each point $P \in U$ there is a [[Zariski Topology|Zariski]] open neighborhood $P \in U' \subseteq U$ of $P$ in $U$ and a pair of element $f, g$ in $A(X)$[^3] such that $$\alpha(P) = \frac{f(Q)}{g(Q)}$$ for all $Q \in U'$. This includes the condition that $g(Q) \ne 0$ for all $Q \in U'$ (i.e., $U' \subseteq D_X(g).)$

The collection of all regular functions on $U$ is written as $\cO_X(U)$.
