#### $\defn$ â€“ Codimension
Given a closed irreducible subset $Y$ of $X$, the *codimension* of $Y$ in $X$, written $\codim_X(Y)$, is the supremum over all $n$ such that a choice of the form
$$Y = Y_0 \subsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subseteq X.$$
When $Y$ is reducible, sometimes one defines $\codim_X(Y)$ to be the *minimum* value of $\codim_X(Y')$ where $Y'$ ranges over the irreducible components of $Y$. (This is similar to the height of an ideal)
