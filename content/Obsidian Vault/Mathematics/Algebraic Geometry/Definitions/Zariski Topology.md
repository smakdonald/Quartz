#### $\defn$ – Zariski Topology
The *Zariski topology* on $\A^n_k$[^1] is the topology in which a subset is closed if and only if it is a variety (i.e., cut out by a collection of polynomial equations). Given a variety $V$in $\A^n_k$, the *Zariski topology* on $V$ is the subspace topology – since $V$ is closed in $\A^n_k$, this means that a subset $C$ of $V$ is closed if and only if $C$ is a subvariety of $V$.
