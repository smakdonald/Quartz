#### $\defn$ â€“ Distinguished Open Subset
A *distinguished open subset* of $\A^n_k$ is the complement of the variety cut out by a single polynomial $f \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$[^1]. That is, $$D(f) := \{(a_1, \dots, a_n \in \A^n_k \mid f(a_1, \dots, a_n) \ne 0\}$$is a distinguished open subset. More generally, a distinguished open subset of an [[Affine Variety|affine variety]] $X$ is an open subset of the form $D_X(f) = X \cap D(f)$ for some $f$.
