##### Week 1: Functions, Function Notation

Write the definition of a function:

Which of the following are functions? Why?

Input: a chair
Output: the number of legs the chair has

Input: a pair of dice
Output: the number that was rolled

Input: a zebra
Output: the number of stripes on the zebra

Identify Input and Output Variable in Notation

Consider the function $f(x)=2x+1$. 
Which is the input and which is the output?

Evaluate these functions: 
- $f(x)=2x+1$ when $x=3$
- $g(x)=-4x^2$ when $x=5$
- $h(x)=34$ when $x=7$

State the Vertical Line Test in a way that makes sense to you.
