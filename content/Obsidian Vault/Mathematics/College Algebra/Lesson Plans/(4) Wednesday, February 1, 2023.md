### Before Class
Print Section 1.2 worksheet (maybe 7 copies or so)
Pull up Problem 4 from Function WeBWorK

### Announcements
- Great job on the first WeBWorK! Very impressed. Problem 4 seemed to be the most challenging, so I thought we could look at that together
- Function Notation WeBWorK is due tomorrow night! Some of you have already started, so I can take questions about anything from that HW right now, this is a thing I can start doing each class
- The last day to take the CRA is tomorrow! I haven't gotten many questions about it at all, and I know you have some! 

### 1.2 Rates of Change

First, a note on increasing and decreasing. Increasing means, you guessed it, going up. Decreasing means going down. Here's a graph, is it increasing or decreasing? Draw Sine graph? Now what? It goes up and down, but we can break it into the increasing bits and the decreasing bits. What about the top and the bottom? It's not really either, so we use open intervals for increasing and decreasing. 

Also, if the graph of a function has arrows on the ends then we can assume that the function continues in that same general direction. So it would be increasing to infinity or negative infinity.

If I walk five feet in five seconds, how many feet did I go every second? One! How did you know that? What did you do? Explain it to me. 

What if I went ten feet in two seconds? We divide how far we went by how long it took. Makes some intuitive sense. Now I'm gonna think about this as a function. Distance over time. Time is my input, distance is my output. I started at time 0 and distance 0. Then, after 2 seconds, I had gone 10 feet. This is my rate of change, also known as Slope, which some of you may have heard before. 

The slope of a line is the ratio
$$\frac{\text{ change in $y$-coordinate}}{\text{ change in $x$-coordinate }}$$
as we move from one point to another on the line.

The reason we have things like slope is because they are useful. Believe it or not this wasn't invented to make you miserable, its just a perk. Our intuition covers a few specific cases, but when we write it like this it covers a lot more.

What if the function of my movement was $3x-2$ and I wanted to know my rate of change over seconds 17-24? Sounds like a lot, right? Well, my $x$ values are 17 and 24. These are the times I want to check. But the distance is important too! We can plug in! 72-2=70 and 51-2=49. So I travelled 70-49=21 feet during those 7 seconds, so I was averaging 3 feet per second!

Again, theres a reason we have this stuff. If you make this much money but this much goes to taxes and expenses, how long before I can buy this thing? If I can sew clothes at this rate, how many can I make during this time? At what rate am I producing paintings? How much am I spending on paint per painting? How fast is a population decreasing, and how long do we have to save it? This is at the heart of almost every profession, occupation, or hobby in some way. Its important! I often hear people ask when they are ever going to use this stuff. You use it all the time, just without the name. And you can't use things you don't have. You all have graphing calculators in your pocket, but it doesn't help if you don't know how to use it! And most real life situations aren't something that fits on Mathway. 

Rant over. Find two $x$ values, find two $y$ values, and calculate. That's the barebones. Go crazy.
