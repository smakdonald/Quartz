### Before Class
Print Section 1.7 worksheet (maybe 7 copies or so)

### Announcements
- First WeBWorK assignment is due tomorrow night! Its six questions, make sure you get it done! I can answer emails, but in the evenings I cannot promise to get back to you in a timely manner.
- CRA closes on Thursday, you NEED to keep trying it!!! If there is something keeping you from trying it, let me know! I can work with you. Starting is the hardest part, and I am here to help. If you get a 16/20 it is an Auto 100. If you have tried it by tonight and gotten 10 or more the lowest you can get is a 10. If you get through the Domain and Range stuff early and want to go take it, just let me know and it won't be a problem.
- The MRC! It exists, I forgot to mention that. Sometimes its busy, sometimes its not. There are usually 101 students as well, you can go with classmates and just work in there, good communal space.

### CRA Review
Ask for questions

### 1.3 Domain and Range
Brief review: intervals
Difference between $a<b,a\leq b$, $(a,b)$, $[a,b]$, open dots and closed dots. 

Domain is what goes into the function, range is what comes out.
Domain is all the $x$-values, range is all the $y$-values on a graph.
Domains and ranges can be intervals or sets of points

There are certain no-no's in math. Dividing by 0, square root of negatives (sometimes), negative logs (we'll see this later)
Tangent: dividing by zero, why can't we do that?

We want to find all the points that "break" so we can remove them. 
Example: setting denominator equal to $0$. 
Example: setting quantity inside root $< 0$. (See, this is why it was on the CRA)

Go Wild


Final example: Union of intervals, we write U, WeBWorK will take the letter $U$.
