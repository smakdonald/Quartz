### Before Class
Print out copies of 1.1, just in case some haven't gotten the workbook yet

### Announcements
Names again
WeBWorK 00 is not for a grade, just to get a handle on things / get familiar
CRA still open, can take questions about that (if anyone has attempted)
Hand out practice CRA, I'll post a solution hopefully before this weekend (might be this weekend, life moves fast)

Section 1: Functions (6:40pm)
Functions describe the world around us, they are used almost everywhere. 
- We describe the notion of addition with addition. 
- The movement of sound-waves through the air: function 
- Revenue, Cost, Profit, all functions
Functions are machines where you put input something and get the same output for that input every time. 
- If you tried $3+3$ and got $6$ one time and $56$ the next, addition wouldn't be very useful, would it?
Give me some functions! They don't need to be useful. 
- For example, for my function you put in a chair, and the function will output the number of legs the chair has. 
- Is this really a function? 

Importance of the Equals Sign and what it means
Think of weight on a scale. Equality means we can exchange one thing for the other without the weight changing. 
For example, thanks to addition being so consistent we know for certain that $3+3=6$. Thus, when given something like $(3+3)^2$, we don't need to any extra distribution, because we can say $$(3+3)^2=(6)^{2},$$since $3+3=6$. 

Let's look at Problem 4 now. We have $x$ and $f(x)$. Part (a) asks for $f(2)$. In other words, we are asking what $f(x)$ is equal to when $x=2$. Since $x=2$, I can swap them out, free of charge! So I get $f(2)$. And according to our table, when I plug $2$ into $f$ it gives me $6$ back! So $f(2)=6$. 

This might seem a little over the top at the moment, but I promise that if you can think of equals signs like this it will make a world of difference later on. 

Let them loose!

(7:25pm) Five minute break

Section 2: Function Notation (7:30)
Problem 2, remember those equals signs?
Watch those parenthesis and those negatives!!!
