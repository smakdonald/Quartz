### Before Class
Print Retakes (might wait till Monday tbh)

### Announcements
- I'll give back the quizzes on Monday, just waiting for a few people to take it
- To get points back you'll essentially be getting a different version of the quiz to do, fill it out and turn it back in to get up to 5 points back.
- RoC Homework is Due Tomorrow Night!

### 1.4 Finding Linear Functions
Slope-Intercept Form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertical intercept. 
Point Slope Form: $y=m(x-x_{1})+y_{1}$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_{1},y_{1})$ is a point on the line.
