## Introduction to Groups
### Definition and First Examples
#### $\defn$ – Binary Operation
![[Binary Operation]]
#### $\rem$
We often write $xy$ instead of $x\cdot y$.
#### $\rem$
We say that “$S$ is closed under the operation $\cdot$”, when we want to emphasize that for any $x, y\in S$ the result of the operation, $xy$, is an element of $S$. However note that closure is really part of the definition of a binary operation on a set, and it is implicitly assumed whenever we consider such an operation.
#### $\defn$ – Group
![[Group]]
#### $\rem$
Although a group is a pair, we will usually refer to the group by only naming the underlying set, $G$.

#### $\rem$
For the uniqueness part of statement (1) in the above proposition one needs to establish a convention regarding 1-cycles, that is one needs to stipulate either that the 1-cycles will not be recorded (which gives the shortest such factorization) or that all the 1-cycles will be recorded (which gives the longest such factorization, but also the only one that makes it clear what the number $n$ is).

## Subgroups
### $\defn$ and Examples
#### $\defn$ – Subgroup
A nonempty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is called a *subgroup* provided $H$ is a group under the multiplication law of $G$. The fact that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ is denoted $H\leq G$ or $H<G$ if we also mean that $H\neq G$.

### Cyclic Groups
#### $\defn$ – Cyclic Group

The set of all subgroups of a group $G$ is a lattice with respect to containment where the supremum of $A$ and $B$ is $\langle A\cup B\rangle$ and the infimum of $A$ and $B$ is $A\cap B$.
#### $\rem$
The isomorphism $\Psi$ in part 3. of Theorem satisfies: if $d_1\mid d_2$ then $\Psi(d_1)\subseteq \Psi(d_2)$. This means that $\Phi$ is a *lattice isomorphism* between the lattice of divisors of $|G|$ with division and the lattice of subgroups of $G$ with containment. $\Psi^{-1}$ is also a lattice isomorphism.
#### $\prop$ – Universal Mapping Property of a Cyclic Group
![[Proposition – Universal Mapping Property of a Cyclic Group]]
#### $\rem$
This is a particular case of the universal mapping property of a presentation (which we will covered later), since a cyclic group is either presented by $\langle x | x^n = e \rangle$ or $\langle x \mid-\rangle$.

Being a normal subgroup is not a transitive relation. For example, for 
$$V=\{e, (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)\}$$
one can show that $V \norm S_4$ and, since $V$ is abelian (all groups with 4 elements are abelian), the subgroup $H = \{e,(12)(34)\}$ is normal in $V$. But $H$ is {\em not} normal in $S_4$, since for example
$$(1 3) [(1 2)(3 4)] (1 3)^{-1} = (3 2)(1 4) \notin H.$$

Here are some facts about $A_n$:
- $A_n$ has $n!/2$ elements
- $A_n$ can be alternatively described as the set of permutations in $S_n$ which can be written as a product of an even number of 2-cycles (not necessarily disjoint). This follows from the definition above using Lemma \ref
- A cycle is in $A_n$ if and only if its size is odd. This is because an $\ell$-cycle is the product of $\ell-1$ transpositions by the formula $$(i_1 \ i_2 \ \ldots \ i_\ell)=(i_1 \ i_2)(i_2 \ i_3)\cdots (i_{\ell-1} \ i_\ell).$$

### Sylow Theory
#### $\defn$ – Sylow $p$-Subgroup
![[Sylow p-Subgroup]]
#### $\rem$
We allow the case when $p\nmid |G|$, in which case $e = 0$ and $G$ has a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup, namely $\{e\}$ which has order $p^0$.
#### $\ex$ – Sylow and $D_{2p}$
In $D_{2p}$ for a prime $p$, $\langle r \rangle$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup. If $p > 2$, there is only one Sylow $p$-subgroup of $D_{2p},$ so $n_p=1$. 
In $D_{2n}$ for $n$ odd, each of the subgroups $\langle sr^j \rangle$, for $j = 0, \dots, n-1$ is a Sylow $2$-subgroup, so $n_2=p$.
#### Example – Sylow and $S_5$
In $S_5$, the Sylow $5$-subgroups are the cyclic groups $\langle \sigma \rangle$ for any five cycle $\sigma$, so $n_5=6$ because there are 24 five cycles, but there are four of these in every Sylow 5-subgroup. The Sylow $3$-subgroups are the cyclic groups $\langle \sigma \rangle$ for any three cycle $\sigma$, so $n_3=10$ because there are 20 three cycles, but there are two of these in every Sylow 3-subgroup. 
A Sylow $2$-subgroup of $S_5$ is any subgroup of order $8$. For example $\langle (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3) , (1 \, 2 \, 3 \, 4) \rangle$ is a Sylow $2$-subgroup. There are many others.
#### $\lem$ – Unique Subgroups of Order are Normal
![[Lemma – Unique Subgroups of Order are Normal]]
#### Theorem – Main Theorem of Sylow Theory
![[Theorem – Main Theorem of Sylow Theory]]
#### $\ex$ – Simple Groups and Element Counting
Let us prove that no group or order $12$ is simple. Let $G$ be any group of order $12$. We will prove that $G$ must have either a normal subgroup of order $3$ or a normal subgroups of oder $4$.
Sylow theory gives that $n_2=|\Syl_2(G)|$ is either $1$ or $3$ and $n_3= |\Syl_3(G)|$ is either $1$ or $4$. If either of these numbers is $1$, we have a unique subgroup of order $4$ or of order $3$, and such a subgroup must be normal. Suppose these numbers are $3$ and $4$, respectively. We deduce a contradiction by "counting elements''. 
In detail, say $P_1, \dots, P_4$ are the $4$ Sylow $3$-subgroups. By Lagrange $P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}$ for all $i \ne j$. Thus the *set* $T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i$ has $9$ elements, one of which is $e$ and the other $8$ of which must have order $3$. That is, there are $8$ elements of order $3$ in $G$. But now consider the three Sylow $2$-subgroups $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$. Each has order $4$ and $Q_i \cap T = \{e\}$ for all $i$. It follows that $Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)$ for all $i$, and thus $Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3$, a contradiction.
#### Warning
In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order $2$ and $4$. We do know that every element in $S := \cup_i Q_i$ has order $1$, $2$ or $4$ (any only one has order $1$), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. For notice that $Q_i \cap Q_j$ might have order $2$. The most one can say for sure is that $S$ has at least $4 + 4 - 2 = 6$ elements.
#### Theorem – Cauchy's Theorem
![[Theorem – Cauchy's Theorem]]
#### $\rem$
In general, Cauchy's Theorem can be deduced from part one of the Sylow Theorem. For say $p \mid \#G$. Then there exists a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$. Pick any $x \in P$, $x \ne e$. Then $|x| = p^j$ for some $j \geq 1$. Then $x^{p^{j-1}}$ has order $p$. 
However, we will use (a more restrictive form of) Cauchy's Theorem to prove Sylow's Theorem, so it is important to see that Cauchy's Theorem can be proven independently of Sylow theory.
#### $\rem$
I mentioned that Cauchy's Theorem is a consequence of part (1) of the Sylow Theorem, but we have used Cauchy in the proof here. Notice, however, that we only need Cauchy for *abelian groups* in this proof, and that is easier to prove.
#### $\ex$ – Simple Groups and Conjugation
No group of order $80=5 \cdot 16$ is simple.
By way of contradiction suppose $G$ is
simple and $|G| = 80$. Sylow theory gives $|\Syl_2(G)| = 5$ and $|\Syl_5(G)| = 16$ (since they cannot be $1$ by the assumption that $G$ is simple). The "counting elements trick'' would work, but let's proceed in a different way: Consider the action of $G$ on $\Syl_2(G)$ by conjugation and let
$$\rho: G \to S_5$$
be the associated permutation representation (obtained by choosing a numbering $1, \dots, 5$ of the members of $\Syl_2(G)$). The map $\rho$ is non-trivial since the action is transitive by part (2) of the Sylow Theorem. But $80$ does not divide $120$ and so $\rho$ cannot be injective. It follows that $\ker(\rho)$ is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup of $G$, a contradiction.

# Ring Theory
## Introduction to Rings
### Definition and Examples
#### $\defn$ – Rings
![[Ring]]
#### Exercise – Commutativity of Addition
Commutativity of addition is a consequence of the other ring axioms in rings with $1$.
#### $\prop$ – Ring Arithmetic
![[Proposition – Ring Arithmetic]]
#### $\ex$ – Ring Examples
1. $R=\{0\}$ is called the {\em trivial ring}. Notice that in the trivial ring $0=1$. Conversely, if $1 = 0$ in a ring, then $R = \{0\}$, since in this case for all $a$, we have $a \cdot 0 = 0$ and hence $a = a \cdot 1 = a \cdot 0 = 0$. 
2. $\Z$ is a commutative ring.
3. $\Z/n$ is a commutative ring under addition and multiplication modulo $n$. Note that $\Z/n$ is a field if any only if $n$ is prime.
4. The familiar sets of "numbers" $\Q, \R, \C$ are fields.
5. If $R$ is any ring (not necessarily commutative), so is $\M_{n}(R)$ for any natural number $n$, using the usual rules for addition and multiplication of square matrices.
6. Let $i,j,k$ be formal symbols and set $\bH$ to be the four dimensional $\bR$-vector space consisting of all expressions of the form $a + bi + cj + dk$ with $a,b,c,d \in \R$. Addition is vector space addition: $$(a + bi + cj + dk) +(a' + b'i + c'j + d'k) = (a + a') + (b + b') i + (c + c')j + (d + d')k.$$Multiplication is uniquely determined by the axioms of a ring together with the rules $$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, -ji = ij = k, -kj = jk = i, -ik = ki = j.$$and the fact that the real coefficients commute with each other and $i,j,k$. It's not obvious that the multiplication defined in this way satisfies associativity, but in fact it does (this amounts conditions very similar to the associativity of the group $Q_8$). $\bH$ is a division ring, since one can check that $$ (a + bi + cj + dk)^{-1} = \frac{a -bi -cj - dk}{\|a + bi + cj + dk\|}$$where $$\|a + bi + cj + dk \| := a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2.$$In the equation above $\|a + bi + cj + dk \|$ is non-zero real number if $a + bi + cj + dk$ is not the zero element. The quantity $\|a + bi + cj + dk \|$ is called the *norm* of the quaternion $a + bi + cj + dk$.
7. The cartesian product $R\times R'$ of two rings $R$ and $R'$ has a natural ring structure with addition and multiplication defined componentwise: $$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)$$ $$(a,b)\cdot(c,d)=(a\cdot c,b\cdot d)$$
8. If $X$ is a set and $R$ is a ring, let $\Fun(X, R)$ be the collection of set theoretic functions from $X$ to $R$, and define $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ and $(f \cdot g)(x) := f(x) \cdot g(x)$. Then $\Fun(X,R)$ is a ring. If $X$ is a finite set and $|X|=n$, then $\Fun(X,R)$ may be identified with $R^n=\underbrace{R \times \cdots \times R}_n$, the direct product of $n$ copies of $R$.
9. If $A = (A, +)$ is any abelian group, set $\End_{Ab}(A)$ to be the collection of endomorphisms of $A$ – that is, the set of group homomorphisms $f: A \to A$ from $A$ to itself. Then $\End_{Ab}(A)$ is a ring with addition $(f + g)(a) := f(a) + g(a)$ and multiplication $f \cdot g := f \circ g$. This is almost always a non-commutative ring.

#### $\ex$ – Group Rings and $S_3$
Take $G = S_3$ and $R = \R$. Then $\R[S_3]$ is a six dimensional real vector space with basis $\{e, (1 \, 2), (1 \, 3), (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3),(1 \, 3 \, 2) \}$. An element is any expression of the form
$$r_1e + r_2 (1 \, 2) + r_3 (1 \, 3) + r_4 (2 \, 3) + r_5 (1 \, 2 \, 3) + r_6 (1 \, 3 \, 2)$$
where $r_1, \dots, r_6$ are real numbers. 
This ring has some zero divisors – for example
$$(e - (1 \, 2))(e + (1 \, 2)) = e - (1 \, 2) + (1 \, 2) - (1 \, 2)^2 = e - e = 0.$$
Here we are abusing notation a bit – for example, $- (1 \, 2)$ is really $(-1_R) (1 \, 2)$. In general, $1_R g$ is just written as $g$ in $R[G]$ and $(-r)g$ is just written as $- rg$, since $(-r)g$ is the additive inverse of $rg$.

#### $\ex$ – Quaternions and Group Rings
Let $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ denote the group of quaternions and $\R$ the field of real numbers, and let us consider the group ring $\R[Q_8]$. Actually, the notation here is not so good since $(-1) k$ is easily confused with $1 (-k)$, and, even worse, things like $1 \cdot 1$, $1 \cdot (-1)$ are highly confusing. So, let us rename the elements of $Q$, so that $$Q_8 = \{e, e', i, i', j, j', k, k'\}$$so that $e$ is what we were writing as $1$, $e'$ is what we were writing as $-1$, $i'$ is what we were writing as $-i$, etc. So, for example, we now have $i^2 = e'$ in this group.
$\R[Q_8]$ is a non-commutative ring, and you might guess that it is the same as the quaternions $\bH$ defined above, but it can't be: 
$\R[Q_8]$ is $8$-dimensional as a $\R$-vector space whereas $\bH$ is $4$ dimensional. In fact $\R[Q_8]$ is not a division ring, since it has zero divisors: $(e - i)(e + i + i^2 + i^3) =0$ and so neither of the two factors can be units.
The problem is that $(-1) e \in R[Q_8]$ is {\em not} the same thing as $1 e'\in R[Q]$, but we want them to be the same in $\bH$. 
Once we learn about quotient rings, we will be able to show that $\bH$ is the quotient of $R[Q_8]$ by the ideal generated by $e' + e$. Roughly this means we mod out by the relation $e' \sim -e$ and all consequences of this relation. For example, once one imposes this equivalence relation, the element
$$e + i + i^2 + i^3 = e + i + e' + e' i = (e + e') + i(e + e')$$ becomes the zero element. 
#### $\ex$ – Free Abelian Group and Group Rings
Group rings give lots of cool examples of rings, but we will now just focus on the boring case when $G$ is a free abelian group (written with multiplicative
notation) generated by $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. In this case an element of $G$ may be written uniquely as $x_1^{e_1}, \dots, x_n^{e_n}$ for $e_1, \dots, e_n \in\Z$. For any commutative ring $R$ a typical element of $R[G]$ is thus $$\sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \in \Z} r_{e_1, \dots, e_n} x_1^{e_1} x_2^{e_2} \cdots x_n^{e_n}$$
This is a *Laurent polynomial* in the variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ with $R$-coefficients. 
Say $n = 1$ and let $x = x_1$, so that $G = \langle x \rangle$. Then $a x^{-3} + b x^{1} + c + dx^5$ with $a,b,c,d \in R$ is a representative example of an element of $R[G]$. Addition is by combining like powers of $x$. Multiplication is uniquely determined by the fact that it must satisfy the distributive law and $x^i x^j = x^{i +j}$ for $i, j \in \Z$.

Any ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is a subring of $R$, but not any subring is an ideal. For example, in $\R[x]$, the set $S$ of polynomials for which every term has even degree is a subring (it's closed under subtraction and multiplication), but it is not an ideal because it is not closed under multiplication by arbitrary polynomials. Indeed, $p(x)=x^2\in S$, but $xp(x)=x^3\not\in S$.

#### Exercise – Evaluation Homomorphism
If $R\subseteq S$ are commutative rings with $1\neq 0$ and $a\in S$, then the evaluation at $a$ function $\phi:R[x]\to S$ given by $\phi(f(x))=f(a)$ is a ring homomorphism.
#### $\ex$ – $\R[x]/(x^2+1)$
Here is a nice application of the First Isomorphism Theorem. Consider the ring $\R[x]$ and let $I = (x^2 + 1)$ be the principal ideals generated by $x^2+1$. Since $\R[x]$ is commutative, we have $$(x^2 + 1) = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},$$ so $(x^2 + 1)$ is simply the collection of polynomials having $x^2 + 1$ as a factor. I claim that $\R[x]/(x^2 + 1)$ is isomorphic as a ring to $\C$. To prove this we define a map
$$\phi: \R[x] \to \C$$
sending $f(x)$ to $f(i)$, the evaluation of $f$ at $i$. It is easy to check $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism and it is onto since elements of the form $a + bx$ in the source map to all possible complex numbers under $\phi$.
We claim the kernel of $\phi$ is $(x^2 +1)$. It is clear that $x^2 + 1 \in \ker(\phi)$ and it follows that $(x^2 + 1) \subseteq \ker(\phi),$ since $\ker(\phi)$ is a two-sided ideal.
Suppose $\phi(f(x)) = 0$ and write $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)$ with degree of $r(x)$ at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring $\R[x]$. So $r(x) = a + bx$ for real numbers $a,b$. If $r(x) \ne 0$, then $r(i) \ne 0$, which would contradict $f(i) = 0$. So we must have $r(x) = 0$ and hence $f(x) \in (x^2 +1)$.
Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get $$\R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \C$$via the map sending $f(x) + (x^2 + 1)$ to $f(i)$.
Intuitively, we have adjoined a formal symbol $x$ to the real numbers, and by modding out $x^2 + 1$ we have forced $x$ to be a square root of $-1$. That is, we have adjoined $i$ to the real numbers, obtaining $\C$.

#### $\lem$ – Reduction Homomorphism
![[Lemma – Reduction Homomorphism]]
#### $\ex$ – Ideal of $\Z[x]$ and Isomorphism
Consider the ideal $J = (2, x^2 + x + 1)$ of $\Z[x]$. Explicitly, by Lemma \ref{lem:idealgen} we have $$J =\{ p(x)\cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\}.$$ Suppose we want to understand $\Z[x]/J$. Then the Third Isomorphism Theorem is our friend. Set $I=(2)$ and note that $I \subseteq J$, and so by the Third Isomorphism Theorem
$$\Z[x]/J \cong \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}.$$
Next we express both the numerator and the denominator in better terms. I claim
$$\Z[x]/I =\Z[x]/(2) \cong (\Z/2)[x].$$
To see this consider the reduction homomorphism $\rho: \Z[x] \to (\Z/2)[x]$ sending a polynomial $p(x)$ to its reduction modulo $2$. The kernel of this surjective ring map is $I$, establishing our claim by the First Isomorphism Theorem.

Recall that $J/I$ denotes the image of $J$ under the quotient map $\pi:\Z[x]\to \Z[x]/I$.
Therefore we have
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
J/I &=\pi(J)=\{\pi( p(x) \cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\}\\
&=\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot \pi(2) + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\}\\
&=\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot 0 + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\}\\
&=\{ f(x)\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid f(x)\in\Z[x]/I\}=\left((x^2+x+1)+I\right).
\end{eqnarray*}$$
In other words, J/I is the ideal generated by the coset of x^2+x+1 in Z[x]/(2).
Moreover, under the isomorphism $\bar\rho:\Z[x]/I \to (\Z/2)[x]$ discussed above, we have that $f(x)+I\mapsto \ov{f}(x)$, where $\ov{f}(x)$ denotes the reduction of the coefficients of $f$ modulo 2. Therefore $\bar \rho(J/I)=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1]),$ where $[1]$ denotes the congruence class of $1$ modulo 2.
Now we put everything together: consider the ring homomorphism $\varphi=\pi'\circ \bar \rho$ where
$$\Z[x]/I\stackrel{\bar \rho}{\rightarrow}(\Z/2)[x] \stackrel{\pi'}\rightarrow \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.$$
Notice that since $\bar\rho$ and $\pi'$ are surjective, so is $\varphi$, thus $\im(\varphi)=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}$ and 
$$\ker(\varphi)=\ker(\pi'\circ \bar \rho)=\ker(\pi')=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])$$
since $\bar\rho$ is an isomorphism and $\pi'$ is a quotient map. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem to $\varphi$ gives
$$\frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}\cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}$$
and combining this with the Third Isomorphism Theorem further yields
$$\Z[x]/J \cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.$$
#### Theorem – Lattice Theorem for Quotient Rings

It turns out that the ring $F=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}$ we discussed in the previous $\ex$ is a field and by a problem from HW 11, any field $F$ has only two ideals $(0)$ and $F$ itself. This implies via the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem that there are only two ideals in $(\Z/2)[x]$ which contain $([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])$, namely $([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])=\pi^{-1}(0)$ and $(\Z/2)[x]=\pi^{-1}(F)$.

By the Third Isomorphism Theorem, and because $\Z[x]/(x)\cong\Z$ and under this isomorphism $(2,x)/(x)$ is mapped to $(2)$, we have (omitting some details) $$\frac{\Z[x]}{(2,x)}\cong\frac{\Z[x]/(x)}{(2,x)/(x)}\cong\Z/2, \text{ a field}.$$ Since the quotient ring is field, we conclude that $(2,x)$ is maximal.

#### $\ex$ – The Trivial Norm
A "degenerate'' example is a field $F$ equipped with the trivial norm $N(r) = 0$ for all $r$. Given $a,b \in F$ with $b \ne 0$, we have $a =(ab^{-1})b + 0$.
Note that in this example there is no need to include "$r=0$'' in the description of the division algorithm, since $b \ne 0$ implies $|0| < |b|$. This is not the case in other examples. Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are {\em not} unique. For example, in dividing $13$ by $5$, both $$13 = 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \text{ and } 13 = 3 \cdot 5 + (- 2)$$ are considered valid.
This calculation shows, more generally, that if $b$ is a unit, then for all $a$ there exists an equation $a = bq + r$ with $r = 0$, not matter what norm $N$ is used.
One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for $\Z$ by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn't generalize to all cases well.
#### $\ex$ – The Gaussian Integers are an ED
The ring $R = \Z[i]$ of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain with $N$ being the usual complex (Euclidean) square norm $N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2$.
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$ $\in \Z[i]$ and let $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=p+qi \in \Q(i)$ (here we use that the fraction field of $\Z[i]$ is $\Q(i)$). Now pick $s,t\in\Z$ so that $|p-s|\leq 1/2$ and $|q-t|\leq 1/2$. We have
$$\a=\beta(s+ti)+\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti).$$
Set $q=s+ti$ and set $r=\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti)=\beta(s+ti-(p+qi))$ and notice that $q\in \Z[i]$ because $s,t\in\Z$ and $r\in \Z[i]$ by closure. If $r=0$ we're good, and if $r\neq 0$ then, using that the complex squared norm is multiplicative as well as the Pythagorean Theorem and the choice for $s,t$, we have
$$N(r)=N(\beta(s+ti-(p+qi)))=N(\beta)N(s+ti-(p+qi))\leq N(\beta)\cdot(1/4+1/4)<N(\beta).$$
Thus the norm function $N$ makes $\Z[i]$ into a Euclidean domain.

- the element $13=(2+3i)(2-3i)$ is not irreducible in $\Z[i]$
- the polynomial $x^2+x+[1]\in (\Z/2)[x]$ is irreducible; indeed if it factors nontrivially, it must factor as a product of two linear polynomials: $x^2+x+[1]=(x+[a])(x+[b])$. Then $-[b]$ is a root for $x^2+x+[1]$. But neither $[0]$ nor $[1]$ are roots for this polynomial, a contradiction.
#### $\ex$ – In $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$, $2$ Irreducible but not Prime
In the domain $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ the element $2$ is irreducible but not prime. Note that $2\cdot 3=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$ and thus $(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})\in (2)$. However we claim that neither $1+\sqrt{-5}$ nor $1-\sqrt{-5}$ are in $(2)$. If $\a=1\pm\sqrt{-5}\in (2)$ then $\a=2\beta$ for some $\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ and so $6=N(\a)=N(2)N(\beta)=4N(\beta)$, a contradiction. Thus $2$ is not prime.

In the ring $\C[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)$ the element $y$ is irreducible but not prime.
Since $\C[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)\cong \C[t^3, t^2]\subseteq \C[t]$ this ring is a domain. The element $y$ is irreducible for degree reasons. The ideal $(y)$ contains $x^2$ but doesn't contain $x$ so $y$ is not prime.

$\Z[x]$ is not a PID hence also not a Euclidean domain. For $\ex$, this can be seen because the ideal $(2,x)$ is not a principal ideal. It is a UFD because $\Z$ is a UFD (based on the result that if $R$ is a UFD then so is $R[x]$ which we will prove shortly).
#### $\ex$ – $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ not a UFD
$\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is a domain that is not a UFD, as $6=(1 + \sqrt{-5}) (1 - \sqrt{-5})=2\cdot 3$ and each of $1 + \sqrt{-5},1 - \sqrt{-5},2, 3$ are irreducible by a norm argument (exercise).
Notice also that $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ contains elements that are irreducible but not prime: $2$ is irreducible, by a norm argument. But it is not prime since $(1 + \sqrt{-5}) (1 - \sqrt{-5})\in (2)$ but neither $1 + \sqrt{-5}$ nor $1 - \sqrt{-5}$ is in $(2).$

If $S$ contains $1$ and is closed under $\cdot$ but does contain some zero divisors, then a ring of fraction construction $S^{-1}R$ still exists; the only modification needed is in the definition for the equivalence relation: declare $\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'}$ iff $s''(rs' - r's) = 0$ for some $s'' \in S$. In that case, the map $R\to S^{-1}R$ is no longer necessarily injective.

## Generalities on Modules
### Definition and Examples
#### $\defn$ – Module 
![[Module]]
#### $\rem$ 
If $R$ is a commutative ring, then any left $R$-module $M$ may be regarded as a right $R$-module by setting $m r = r m$. Likewise, any right $R$-module may be regarded as a left $R$-module. But for non-commutative rings, left and right modules are not the same: trying to make a left $R$-module $M$ into a right one by setting $mr = rm$ fails to satisfy the second axiom, since $m(rs) = (rs)m$ and $(mr)s = (rm)s = s(rm) = (sr)m$, and, unless $rs =sr$, we cannot conclude that $m(rs) = (mr)s$.
#### Exercise – Opposite Ring
Given a ring $R$, let $R^{op}$, the 'opposite ring', denote the same set with same rule for $+$, but with multiplication redefined as $a \cdot_{op} b := b a$ (where $ba$ on the right is the original multiplication ring). Then $R^{op}$ is also a ring – note that it coincides with $R$ if and only if $R$ is commutative. Given a left $R$-module $M$, show that $M$ is a right $R^{op}$-module via the rule for scaling given by $m r := rm$.
#### $\lem$ – Arithmetic in Modules
![[Lemma – Arithmetic in Modules]]
#### $\ex$ – Modules
- For any $R$, the trivial module is $0=\{0\}$ with $r0=0$ for any $r\in R$.
- Every ring $R$ is a left module over itself whit the rule for scaling given by the ring multiplication rule. It is also a right module over itself. 
- More generally, if $R$ is any ring and $I$ is a left ideal, then $I$ is a left-$R$-module.
- Let $F$ be a field and $R = \Mat_{n \times n}(F)$ (the ring of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $F$). Let $M$ be the collection of column vectors with entries in $F$ having $n$ entries. The usual rules for adding column vectors and multiplying column vectors on the left by matrices make $M$ into a left $R$-module. Likewise if $N$ is the collection of all row vector with $n$ entries in $F$, the $N$ is a right $R$-module via addition and matrix multiplication.
#### $\ex$ – Standard Free Module
For a non-negative integer $n$, the "standard'' free (left) $R$-module of rank $n$ is the set
$$
R^n=\left\{\begin{bmatrix} r_1\\ \vdots \\r_n \end{bmatrix} \mid r_i\in R, 1\leq i\leq n\right\}
$$
equipped with the operations
$$
\begin{bmatrix} r_1\\ \vdots\\r_n \end{bmatrix} +\begin{bmatrix} r'_1\\ \vdots\\r'_n \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} r_1+r'_1\\ \vdots\\r_n +r'_n\end{bmatrix} \text{ and }
r\begin{bmatrix} r_1\\ \vdots\\r_n \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} rr_1\\ \vdots\\ rr_n \end{bmatrix}.

Let's prove $f = x^4 + 7x^3 + 16 x^2 + 124 x + 23 \in \Q[x]$ is irreducible. By Gauss's Lemma, we just need to show it is irreducible in $\Z[x]$.

If $f$ did factor in $\Z[x]$ as a product of monic polynomials, then $\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]$ would also factor in this way. Now $\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]$. This has no roots (the only possibilities are $0$ or $1$)
and so if it did factor it would have to factor as a product of two quadratic, irreducible polynomials. The only such polynomial in $\Z/2[x]$ is $q = x^2+ x + 1$ (the others all have roots). But $q^2 \ne \ov{f}$. This proves $\ov{f}$ is irreducible in $(\Z/2)[x]$ and hence $f$ must be irreducible in $\Z[x]$.

Modding out by $3$ yields a linear polynomial in $(\Z/3)[x]$ which is thus irreducible. But clearly $f$ isn't irreducible in $\Z[x]$. (The Proposition can be generalized to non-monic polynomials by adding the assumption that $p$ does not divided the leading coefficient of $f$.) 
## Field Extensions 
### Definition and First properties 
#### $\defn$ – Field Extension
![[Field Extension#$ defn$ – Field Extension]]
#### $\rem$
Recall that if $F$ and $E$ are fields, then every ring homomorphism $\phi: F \to E$ necessarily injective. (Proof: since $\phi(1) = 1$, $\ker(\phi)$ is a proper ideal of $F$, and since $F$ is a field, the only proper ideal of it is $0$.) Thus $\phi$ maps $F$ isomorphically onto its image $\phi(F)$ and $\phi(F) \subseteq E$ is a field exension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of $\phi$ as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields. 
#### $\ex$ – Classic Field Extensions
$\Q \subseteq \R$ and $\R \subseteq \C$ are basic $\ex$s of field extensions.

Recall (perhaps from 817) that $\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}$ is 
a field. So $\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]$ is another $\ex$ of a field extension.
#### $\ex$ – More Field Extensions
Consider $x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]$. It is irreducible (e.g., by Eisenstein) and has roots $\a = \sqrt[3]{2}$, $\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}$ and $\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}$ in $\C$. So there are three ways in which we could "adjoin a root'' to $\Q$:
First we could form the field
$$
\Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
$$
It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it latter.
The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., $\a^3 = 2 \in \Q$.
Or we could instead form the field $\Q[\beta]$ or the field $\Q[\gamma]$. 
There are clearly not all equal since, for $\ex$, $\Q[\a] \subseteq \R$ but $\beta$ is not in $\R$. However, they are {\em isomorphic} field extensions as we will prove below.
#### $\defn$ – $F[\alpha]$
![[Field Extension#$ defn$ – Elemental Field Extension]]
#### $\ex$ – $\Q[\sqrt{2}]$
Take $F = \Q$ and $\a = \sqrt{2}$. Then any expression of the form $\sum_i r_i \a^i$ with $r_i \in \Q$ is equal to one of the form $a + b \sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \in \Q$.
If $c + d \sqrt{2} \ne 0$, then
$$
\frac{1}{c + d \sqrt{2}} = \frac{c-d \sqrt{2}}{c^2 - 2 d^2}
=
c' + d' \sqrt{2}
$$
with $c' = \frac{c}{c^2 - 2d^2}$ and $d' = \frac{-d}{c^2 - 2d^2}$ both in $\Q$. 
This proves that $\Q[\sqrt2] = \Q(\sqrt2) = \{a + b \sqrt2 \mid a,b \in \Q\}$ and in particular that $\Q[\sqrt{2}]$ is a field. 
#### $\ex$ – $\Q[\pi]$
$\Q[\pi]$ is not a field (and so in particular it is not equal to $\Q(\pi)$ since, for $\ex$, $\frac{1}{\pi} \notin \Q[\pi]$. (If it were, then we would have $\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{i=0}^n q_i \pi^i$ for some $q_i \in \Q$, and hence $\sum_i q_i \pi^{i+1} - 1 = 0$, which would imply $\pi$ is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. This is known to be not true.) 
#### $\defn$ – Degree of Field Extension
![[Degree of Field Extension]]
#### $\ex$ – Degrees of Common Extensions
We have that $[\C: \R] = 2$ and $[\R:\Q] = \infty$. (We could in fact say $[\R:\Q]$ is the cardinality of $\R$, but in general we lump all infinite field extensions together when talking about degree.) We have $[\Q[\a]: \Q] = 3$ where $\a = \sqrt[3]{2}$.
#### $\prop$ – Properties of Extension Degrees
![[Proposition – Properties of Extension Degrees]]
#### $\ex$ – $\R[x]/(x^2+1)$
The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in $\ex$s. So let's do a simple one: Say $F = \R$ and $p(x)= x^2 +1$. Then $L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)$. The assertion is that $\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2 + 1$ viewed as having coefficients in $L$. In other words, this element has the property that its square is $-1$. Let's check: Since $\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0$ and $\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1$ we have $\ov{x}^2 = -1$. Indeed, there is a field isomorphism $L \cong \C$ sending $\ov{x}$ to $i$ and more generally $\ov{f}$ to $f(i).$

#### $\ex$ – $\sqrt{2}$ Primitive
$\sqrt{2}$ is a primitive element of the extension $\Q \subseteq\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \Q(\sqrt{2})$. So is $1 + \sqrt{2}$ and, more generally, $a + b \sqrt{2}$ for any $a, b \in \Q$ with $b \ne 0$.
#### $\defn$ – $F(A)$
![[Field Extension#$ defn$ – Field Extension via Set]]
#### $\ex$ – $\Q(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)$
Regard $\Q$ as a subfield of $\C$ and let $F = \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$.
We may also describe $F$ as $F = E(\sqrt{3})$ where we set $E =\Q(\sqrt{2})$. 

I claim that $F$ is in fact a simple extension of $\Q$. For $\ex$, say $\g = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$. I claim that $\Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) = F$. Note that $\g^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6}$ and
$$\g^3 = 5 \sqrt{2} + 5 \sqrt{3} + 4 \sqrt{3} + 6 \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2} + 9 \sqrt{3}.$$
So $\frac12(\g^3 - 9 \g) = \sqrt{2}$, and hence $\sqrt{2} \in \Q(\g)$. Likewise, $$\sqrt{3} = -\frac12(\g^3 - 11 \g) \in \Q(\g).$$So $\Q(\g) = \Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$.
This $\ex$ is an illustration of the Primitive Element Theorem (which we might or might not have time to prove this semester): Every finite extension of $\Q$ is generated by a single element (or, in other words, is simple). This $\ex$ shows $\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})/\Q$ is simple and $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ is a primitive element of this field extension.
### Algebraic and Transcendental Extensions
#### $\defn$ – Algebraic and Transcendental Elements
![[Algebraic Element]]
#### $\ex$ – $i$ Algebraic over $\R$
$i \in \C$ is algebraic over $\R$. Indeed, every element of $\C$ is algebraic over $\R$. (E.g., $z = a + bi$ is a root of $x^2 -2ax +a^2 + b^2$.) $e^{2 \pi i/n} \in \C$ ia algebraic over $\Q$. So is $\sqrt{m}$ for any $m \in \Z$. 
The numbers $\pi$ and $e$ of $\R$ are transcendental over $\Q$; these are deep facts.

#### $\defn$ – Minimum Polynomial

#### $\rem$
Note that the minimum polynomial of $\a$ over $F$ (if it exists) divides every polynomial in $F[x]$ that has $\a$ as a root. In particular, it is the unique monic, irreducible polynomial having $\a$ as a root. It can also be characterized as the monic polynomial in $F[x]$ of least degree having $\a$ as a root. 
#### $\ex$ – Primitive Roots of Unity
For any prime integer $p$, set $\mu_p = e^{2 \pi i/p}$, a so-called "primitive $p$-th root of unity''. Let us find $m_{\mu_p, \Q}(x)$. Note that $\mu_p$ is a root of $x^p -1$ which factors as $(x-1) g(x)$ where $g(x) = x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1$. As we showed before, $g(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$. Since $\mu_p$ is not a root of $x-1$, it must be a root of $g(x)$, and since $g(x)$ is irreducible, it must be $m_{\mu_p, \Q}(x)$ (see the $\rem$).
#### $\cor$ – Uniqueness of $F(\alpha)$ up to Isomorphism
![[Corollary – Uniqueness of Field Extensions]]
#### $\ex$ – $\Q(\sqrt2)\cong\Q(-\sqrt2)$
A simple $\ex$ illustrating the Corollary is that $\Q(\sqrt{2})$ and $\Q(-\sqrt{2})$ are isomorphic fields. In fact, the are equal: $\Q(\sqrt2) = \Q(-\sqrt{2})$. But the Corollary gives that there is an interesting isomorphism $\phi: \Q(\sqrt2) \xra{\cong} \Q(-\sqrt2) = \Q(\sqrt{2})$ that sends $\sqrt2$ to $-\sqrt{2}$. In general, we have $\phi(a + b \sqrt2) = a - \sqrt2$ for $a,b \in \Q$. This previews the central idea of Galois theory.
#### $\ex$ – Cube Roots
Let $\a=\sqrt[3]{2}$ (the unique real cube-root of $2$) and $\beta = e^{2\pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}$ (one of the two imaginary cube roots of $2$). 

Then by the Corollary (applied with $L = L' = \C$) there is an isomorphism $\Q(\a) \cong \Q(\beta)$ of fields that restricts to the identity map on $\Q$. Note that these two fields are not equal since the former is contained in $\R$ and the latter is not. 
#### $\prop$ – The Degree Formula
![[Proposition – The Degree Formula]]
***
#### $\ex$ – $\R(w)=\C$ for all $w\not\in\R$
Say $F \subseteq L$ is a field extension of prime degree $p$. Given $w \in L \setminus F$, by the Degree Formula we have $[L:F(w)][F(w):F] = [L:F] = p$. Since $w \notin F$, $F \subsetneq F(w)$ and so $[F(w): F] > 1$. It follows that $[L: F(w)] = 1$, whence $L = F(w)$. As a (very simple) $\ex$ of this, since $[\C: \R]$ is prime, $\R(w) = \C$ for any complex number $w$ that is not real. 
#### $\ex$ – Degree and $x^2-5$ 
Let $F$ be the result of adjoining to $\Q$ all of the roots in $\C$ of $x^2 - 5$. That is, $F = \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3, \a_4)$ where $\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{5}$, $\a_2 = i \sqrt[4]{5}$, $\a_3 = -\sqrt[4]{5}$, and $\a_4 = - i \sqrt[4]{5}$. As we shall see later, $F$ is an $\ex$ of a "splitting field''. Let's find $[F: \Q]$. 

First, let us note that we can also describe $F$ as $F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)$. This holds since each of $\a_1, \dots, \a_4$ belongs to $\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)$ and hence $F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)$. The opposite containment holds because $\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F$, with the latter being true because $i = \a_2/\a_1$.

Set $E = \Q(i)$. Then $[E: \Q] = 2$. Since $F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})$ and $\sqrt[4]{5}$ is a root of $x^4-5$, we have $[F : E]$ is at most $4$ and it will be exactly $4$ if and only if $x^4 -5$ is irreducible in $\Q(i)[x]$. This is unclear.

So instead let's try a different approach. Let $L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})$. Then since $x^4 - 5$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ by Eisenstein, we have $[L: \Q] = 4$. Since $F = L(i)$ and $i$ is a root of $x^2 +1$, we have $[F:L] \leq 2$. But $F \ne L$ since $F \subseteq \R$. Note that $[F:L] = 1$ if and only if $F = L$. Thus $[F:L] = 2$.

By the degree formula we conclude that
$$
[F: \Q] = [F:L][L:\Q] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8.
$$
Note that, in hindsight, it must have been true that $x^4 - 5$ is irreducible in $\Q(i)[x]$, since otherwise the degree formula would give that $[F: \Q] < 8$. 
#### $\defn$ – Algebraic Extension

#### $\prop$ – Finite Extensions are Algebraic
![[Proposition – Finite Extensions are Algebraic]]
#### $\ex$ – Infinite Algebraic Extension
Let $E_n = \Q(\sqrt[n]{2})$ and set $F = \bigcup_n E_n$. Then $F$ is a subfield of $\C$: To see this, note first that $E_n \subseteq E_m$ provided $n \mid m$. Given $a, b \in F$, we have $a \in E_n$ and $b \in E_m$ for some $n$ and $m$ and hence $a,b$ are both in $E_{mn}$. Since $E_{mn}$ is a field, we have $a + b$, $a-b$, $a \cdot b$ and (provided $a \ne 0$) $\frac{1}{a}$ all belong to $E_{mn}$ and hence to $F$. This proves $F$ is field extension of $\Q$. It is algebraic over $\Q$ since each $E_n$ is. But it is not a finite extension of $\Q$, since $[E_n: \Q] = n$ (since $x^n - 2$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ by Eisenstein) and hence $[F: \Q] \geq n$ for all $n$.
#### $\prop$ – Algebraic Extensions are Transitive
![[Problem – Algebraic Extensions are Transitive]]

The converse of this proposition is also true: Given field extensions $F \subseteq L \subseteq E$, if $F \subseteq E$ is algebraic then so are $L \subseteq E$ and $F \subseteq L$. This is more or less obvious from the definition.

### Splitting fields
#### $\defn$ – Splitting Field
![[Splitting Field]]
#### $\ex$ – Common Splitting Fields
- As a silly $\ex$, if $f(x)$ already splits into linear factors over $F[x]$, then $F$ itself is the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$.
- The splitting field of $x^2 + 1$ over $\R$ is $\C$. 
- If $q(x)$ is any irreducible quadratic polynomial in $\R[x]$, then the splitting field of $q(x)$ is $\C$.
- In general, given $f(x) \in \Q[x]$, a splitting field of $f(x)$ is given by $\Q(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)$ where $\a_1, \dots, \a_n \in \C$ are all of the roots of $f(x)$ in $\C$. 
#### $\rem$
More generally, we may speak of the splitting field of a list of polynomials in $F[x]$: it is a field extension over which each polynomial factors completely and which is generated by all the roots of all the polynomials. 

Note that given a finite list $f_1(x), \dots, f_k(x) \in F[x]$, a splitting field for this list is identical to a splitting field for their product $f_1(x)\cdots f_k(x)$.
#### $\thm$ – Properties of Splitting Fields
![[Theorem – Properties of Splitting Fields]]
#### $\rem$
Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension $F \subseteq E$ in which $f(x)$ has at least one root. So $f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)$ for some $\a_1 \in E$ and $g(x) \in E[x]$. We can then find a field extension of $E$ in which $g$ has at least one root $\a_2$, and so on. In this way we build a field extension $F \subseteq K$ such that $g$ factors in $K$ as $c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)$ for some $c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K$. Finally, $L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)$ is a splitting field of $f$.
#### $\ex$ – Splitting Fields and $(x^3-2)$
The splitting field $L$ of $x^3 -2$ over $\Q$ is $L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})$, where $\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}$.
It is not hard to see that $L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)$. We have $[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3$ since $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ (by Eisenstein). Since $\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R$ and thus $\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L$, the degree formula gives that $[L: \Q] \geq 6$. By the Theorem, $[L: \Q] \leq 6$ and hence $[L: \Q] = 6$. (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)
#### $\ex$ – Splitting Fields and $(x^4-5x^2+6)$
The splitting field of $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6$ is 
$$
\Q(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}).
$$
This holds since $f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)$. It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over $\Q$ is $4$, far smaller than the $4!$ upper bound given by the Theorem.
#### $\ex$ – Splitting Fields and $(x^n-1)$
Let $f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]$. Then $f(x)$ splits completely in $\C[x]$ and its roots are the $n$ $n$-th roots of $1$. One of these is $\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}$. Notice that every other $n$-th root of $1$ is a power of this one. We thus see that $\Q(\zeta_n)$
is the splitting field of $x^n-1$ over $\Q$. This field is called the {\em cyclotomic field} of $n-th$ roots of 1 over $\Q$. This is a somewhat special $\ex$: upon joining one of the roots of $f$ we got all the others for free. This happens in other $\ex$s too, but is certainly {\em not} a general principle.

In particular, we see that the degree of $\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)$ is at most $n$, far less than the bound of $n!$ given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most $n-1$ since $f$ factors as $(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)$, and hence the minimum polynomial of $\zeta_n$
is a divisor of $x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1$. 

When $n = p$ is prime, then $x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1$ is irreducible, as we proved before, 
and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of $\zeta_p$. So, in this case, 
the degree of $\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)$ is exactly $p-1$, but it can be smaller than $n-1$ in general;
for $\ex$, when $n = 4$, $\zeta_4= i$ and $[\Q(i): \Q] = 2$. Note that $x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ factors as $(x^2+1)(x+1)$ and of course $m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1$.

The irreducible polynomial $m_{\zeta_n, \Q}(x)$ is known as the {\em $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial}.
#### Porism – *The* Porism
![[Porism – The Porism]]
#### $\ex$ – Porism and $(x^3-2)$
Let $L$ be the splitting field of $x^3 - 2$ over $\Q$; so $L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2})$.

The Porism gives that there is a field automorphism $\s$ of $L$ such that $\s(e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}) = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}$. This one is clear – complex conjugation gives such an isomorphism.

It also gives there is a field automorphism $\tau$ of $L$ such that $\tau(\sqrt[3]{2}) = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}$. This is less obvious.

$x^4 -x^3 -x + 1$ is not separable sine $x-1$ is a double root (it factors as $(x^3-1)(x-1) = (x^2+x+1)(x-1)^2$). As predicted by the Theorem, it fails to be relatively prime to its derivative, which is $4x^3 - 3x^2 -1$, since each are divisible by $x-1$. 

$x^3-1$ is separable in $\R[x]$ because it has 3 distinct roots in $\C$, namely $1,\zeta_3,\zeta_3^2$. As predicted by the Theorem, it is relatively prime to its derivative $3x^2$.

Now interpret $x^3 - 1$ as belonging to $(\Z/3)[x]$. Then $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)^3$ is not separable. As predicted by the Theorem, it is not relatively prime to its derivative, which is $0$. 
#### $\ex$ – $\Z/p(y)$
Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p > 0$ and assume $a \in F$ is an element such that $a \ne b^p$ for all $b \in F$.Then $x^p - a$ is irreducible but not separable. It is not separable since in $\ov{F}$ we have $x^p - a= (x-b)^p$ where $b^p = a$. Also note that its derivative is $px^{p-1} = 0$. 

It is less obvious that it is irreducible, but we can see that this is indeed the case in a specific $\ex$: Take $F = \Z/p(y)$ (the field of fractions of the polynomial ring $\Z/p[y]$) and let $a = y$. In this case, $x^p - y$ is seen to be irreducible, by Eisenstein, but not separable.

Let $y$ and $z$ be indeterminants. The extension of fields $F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z)= L$ given by identifying $y$ with $z^p$ is not separable. Somewhat more precisely, $F$ is isomorphism to the subfield of $L$ consisting of elements of the form $\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}$,
with the isomorphism given by sending $\frac{\sum_i a_i y^{i}}{\sum_j b_j y^{j}}$ to $\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}$.

Then $z \in L$ is a root of the polynomial $x^p - y \in F[x]$. Moreover since $F$ is the field of fractions of the PID $R = (\Z/p)[y]$ and $y$ is a prime element of $R$, we may apply Eisenstein (and Gauss) to conclude that $x^p - y$ is irreducible in $F[x]$. This proves that
$m_{z, F}(x) = x^p - y$. This polynomial is not separable since in $L[x]$ it is equal to $(x-z)^p$ and hence has a repeated root. (Or, you may use that its derivative is $0$.)
## Galois theory
### Introduction 
#### $\defn$ – Automorphism Group
![[Automorphism#$ defn$ – Field Automorphism Group]]
#### $\ex$ – $\Aut(\C/\R)$
I claim $\Aut(\C/\R)$ has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order $2$): the identity map on $\C$ and the element $\s$ given as complex conjugation. It is easy to see each of these is an element of $\Aut(\C/\R)$ --- for $\s$, this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends $1$ to $1$).

To see these are the only elements of $\Aut(\C/\R)$, suppose $\tau \in \Aut(\C/\R)$. For any $z = a + ib \in \C$, we have $\tau(z) = a + b \tau(i)$ since $\tau|_\R = \id_\R$. Moreover, $-1 = \tau(-1) = \tau(i \cdot i) = \tau(i) \cdot \tau(i)$ and so $\tau(i) = \pm 1$. Thus $\tau = \id$ or $\tau = \s$.
#### $\ex$ – $\Aut(\Q(\sqrt d)/\Q)$
For any square-free integer $d$, $\Aut(\Q(\sqrt{d})/\Q)$ has order $2$, and its two elements are the identity and the map sending $a + b \sqrt{d}$ to $a - b \sqrt{d}$. Checking that each really is an element of this group and that there are the only two elements in this group is done similarly to the previous $\ex$.
#### $\ex$ – $\Aut$ and $(x^3-2)$
For a more complicated $\ex$, let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^3 - 2$ over $\Q$. Recall
$$
K= \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3)
$$
$$
\a_1 = \sqrt[3]{2}, \a_2 = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, \a_3 = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}.
$$
Let us ponder how big $\Aut(K/\Q)$ could be. Pick any $\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)$.
Since $\s$ is a ring homomorphism, for any $i$ we have 
$$
\s(\a_i)^3 = \s(\a_i^3) = \s(2) = 2
$$
and thus $\s(\a_i)$ is also a root of $x^2 - 2$. In other words, for each $i$ we have $\s(\a_i) = \a_j$ for some $j$.
Moreover, since $K$ is generated as a field extension of $\Q$ by $\a_1, \a_2, \a_3$, 
the action of $\s$ on the three roots completely determines the action of $\s$ on all of $K$. In more detail, every element of $K$ is given taking $\Q$-linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of $\Aut(K/\Q)$ preserves
sums, products and $\Q$-linear combintations. 

To summarize, we have proven that there are {\em at most} $3! = 6$ possibilites for $\s$. 
In fact, more is true: The function
$$
\phi: \Aut(K/\Q) \to \Perm(\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\})
$$
given by sending $\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)$ to its restriction to the subset $\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\}$ is an injective group homomorphism. 
Thus $\Aut(K/\Q)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_3$. 
I claim that $\# \Aut(K/\Q) = 6$ and hence $\Aut(K/\Q) \cong S_3$.
I will prove this directly – we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.

First we notice that the field automorphism of $\C$ given by complex conjugation, namely $\C \to \C, z \mapsto \overline{z}$, permutes the roots of $x^3 - 2$ and hence it restricts to a field map from $K$ into $K$. Since this map is $\Q$-linear and injective (as are all field maps) and $K$ is a finite dimensional $\Q$-vector space, this map must be onto as well. So, we obtain
an element $\a \in \Aut(K/\Q)$ given by $\a(z) = \overline{z}$ for all $z \in K$. 
It corresponds $(2 \, 3) \in S_3$. 

Next, we apply Porism \ref{por418}, which gives $\gamma \in \Aut(K/\Q)$ such that $\gamma(\sqrt[3]{2})=e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}$. 
So, in the numbering above, $\gamma$ corresponds to either $(1 \, 2)$ or $(1 \, 2 \, 3)$ in $S_3$. We don't really know which of these it is. (In fact, both will occur --- the map $\gamma$ is not unique.)
But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets $\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2)\}$ and $\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3)\}$ of $S_3$ generated all of $S_3$. 

In other words, every possible permutation of roots of $x^3 - 2$ arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over $\Q$. This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of $x^3 - 2$ are "as symmetric as possible''.

#### $\ex$ – $[L:\Q]$ and $(x^4 − 2)$
Let $L$ be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial $q(x) = x^4 - 2 \in \Q[x]$. 
So $L = \Q(R)$ where $R = \{z_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, z_2 = i \sqrt[4]{2}, z_3= - \sqrt[4]{2}, z_4 = - i\sqrt[4]{2})\}$. 
By the Corollary above, the action of $\Aut(L/\Q)$ on $R$ is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism $\Aut(L/\Q) \to \Perm(R)$.

Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no $\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)$ such that 
$\s(z_1) = z_2$, $\s(z_2) = z_1$, $\s(z_3) = z_3$, and $\s(z_4) =z_4$; i.e., the permutation $(1 \, 2)$ of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. To see this note that if $\s(z_1) = z_2$ then $\s(z_3) = \s(-z_1) = - \s(z_1) = - z_2 = z_4$. So, any field automorphism that interchanges $z_1$ and $z_2$ would have to also interchange $z_3$ and $z_4$.
In fact, as we shall see, $\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 8$, considerably smaller than $4!$.

Let us compute $[L:\Q]$.
Note that $i \in L$ since $i = z_2/z_1$ and in fact $L = \Q(z_1, i)$. In the chain of extensions
$$
\Q \subset \Q(z_1) \subset L = \Q(z_1)(i)
$$
the first one has degree $4$, since $x^4 - 2$ is irreducible by Eisenstein, and the second has degree at most $2$ since $i$ is a root of $x^2 + 1$. It would be less than two if $x^2+1$ factors in $\Q(z_2)[x]$. But since $\Q(z_1) \subset \R$ and $L$ is not contained in $\R$, the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly $2$. We conclude $[L:\Q] = 8$. It follows from Proposition \ref{prop421} that $\# \Aut(L/\Q) \leq 8$.
(In fact, since $L$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that $\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 8$. But we won't appeal to this fact here.)

We claim $\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 8$ and $\Aut(L/\Q)$ is isomorphic to the subgroup $H$ of $S_4$ generated by $(2 \, 4)$ and $(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)$. (This is isomorphic to $D_8$.)

The map $\C \to \C$ given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of $x^4 - 2$ and it restricts to an automorphism of $L$ --- specially, it fixes $z_1, z_3$ and interchanges $z_2$ and $z_4$. It follows that complex conjugation determines an element $\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)$ that corresponds to $(2 \, 4) \in H \leq S_4$.

By the degree formula we get $[L: \Q(i)] = 4$. Since $L = \Q(i)(z_1)$, the degree of $m_{z_1, \Q(i)}(x)$ must be $4$. This shows that $x^4 - 2$ must remain irreducible as a polynomial in $\Q(i)[x]$; this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will
be useful in what we do next.

To construct another element of $\Aut(L/\Q)$, we use that that $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $x^4 - 2$ over $\Q(i)$ and that, as we just showed, $x^4 - 2$ is irreducible in $\Q(i)[x]$. We may thus apply Porism \ref{por418} (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element $\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))$ such that $\tau(z_1) = z_2$. We may regard $\tau$ as an element of $\Aut(L/\Q)$ since, by definition, $\Aut(L/\Q(i))$ is a subgroup of $\Aut(L/\Q)$.
We have
$$
\tau(z_2) = \tau(i z_1) = \tau(i) \tau(z_1) = i z_2 = z_3
$$
since $\tau(i) = i$ by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified $\tau$ to be an element of $\Aut(L/\Q)$ sending $z_1$ to $z_2$, then we would have no idea what $\tau$ does to $z_2$ --- it was key to define $\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))$ as we did. We then also get $\tau(z_3) = z_4$ and $\tau(z_4) = z_1$. So $\tau$ corresponds to the permutation $(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)$.

We have proven that $\Aut(L/\Q)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$ having order at most $8$ (by the Proposition above) and that it contains $(2 \, 4)$ and $(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)$. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order $8$, the claim follows.

$L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{2 \pi i/3})$ is a normal extension of $\Q$ since it is the splitting field of $x^3-2$.
#### $\ex$ – $\Q(\sqrt[3]2)$ not Normal
Is $\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$ normal? It isn't the splitting field of $x^3 -2$ clearly, but maybe it somehow is the splitting field of some other polynomial. It in fact is not normal,
but it is not so obvious that it isn't. The next Theorem will allow us to prove it isn't normal.

Recall from the Proposition above that $\# \Aut(L/F) \leq [L:F]$ holds for any finite field extension. So, such an extension is Galois if and only if its automorphism group is as large as is allowed by the Proposition. 
#### $\ex$ – Galois Extension
$L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{2 \pi i/3})$ is a Galois extension of $\Q$, since it the splitting field of $x^3 - 2$. We proved above that $\Aut(L/\Q)$ has six elements and $[L: \Q] = 6$, as the Theorem predicts. 
#### $\ex$ – $\Q(\sqrt[3]2)$ not Galois
I claim $L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is not a Galois extension of $\Q$. Let $R$ be the set of all roots of $x^3-2$ in $L$. Since $L \subseteq \R$, $R$ has just one element: $R = \{\sqrt[3]{2}\}$. Since $L = \Q(R)$, the function $\phi: \Aut(L/\Q) \to \Perm(R)$ is injective by Proposition \ref{prop423} and so since $\# R = 1$, we have $\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 1$. Thus it isn't Galois. Since it is separable, $L$ must not be a normal extension of $\Q$.

### FTGT Examples
#### $\ex$ – FTGT and $(x^4-2)$
Let $L$ be the splitting field of $x^4 - 2$ over $\Q$. Let's use the fundamental theorem to list all intermediate fields for $\Q \subseteq L$ and to determine which are Galois over $\Q$. Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields. 

We know $G := \Gal(L/\Q)$ corresponds to the $8$ element subgroup of $S_4$
generated by $\s = (2 \, 4)$ and $\tau = (1 \, 2 \,3 \, 4)$ where we number the roots as $\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, \a_2 = i \a_1, \a_3 = -\a_1, \a_4 =-i\a_1$.

This group is isomorphic to $D_8$ and we can make this isomorphism
explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by $\a_1, \dots,\a_4$, counter-clockwise. So, $\tau$ is rotation by $90$ degrees and $\s$ is reflection about the line joining vertices $1$ and $3$.

The subgroup lattice and intermediate field lattice are represented below, with normal subgroups and Galois extensions highlighted (boxed).

The subgroups are
$$
\begin{aligned}
G &= \langle (2 \, 4), (1 \, 2 \, 3 \,4) \rangle \\
\{e\} & \\
H_1 &= \langle (2 \, 4) \rangle \\
H_2 &= \langle (1 \, 3)\rangle \\
H_3 &= \langle (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)\rangle \\
H_4 & = \langle (1 \,4)(2 \, 3)\rangle \\
H_5 &= \langle (1 \,3)(2 \, 4)\rangle \\
H_6 & = \langle (1 \, 2 \, 3 \,4) \rangle \\
H_7 &= \langle(1 \, 3), (2 \, 4)\rangle \\
H_8 &= \langle (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \,4)(2 \, 3)\rangle \\
\end{aligned}
$$
 and the lattices are
 INSERT IMAGE
The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of $L$ associated to
each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the quesiton, but
let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.

$G$ corresponds to $\Q$ and $e$ corresponds to $L = \Q(\a_1, i)$.

Set $E_i = L^{H_i}$. $E_1$ has degree $4 = [G:H_1]$ over $\Q$. It is clear $\a_1$ (and
$\a_3$) belongs to $E_1$ and since $[\Q(\a_1):\Q]=4$, we must have $E_1 = \Q(\a_1)$.

Likewise $E_2 = \Q(\a_2)$.

$E_3$ also has degree four over $\Q$. Let $\beta = \a_1 + \a_2 = (1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}$ and note $\beta \in E_3$. If $[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2$, then $\beta$ would be fixed by a subgroup of index $2$ that contains $(1 \,2)(3 \, 4)$, and the only possibility is $H_8$. But $(1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)$ sends $\beta$ to $\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta$. So we must have $[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4$ and hence $E_3 = \Q(\beta)$.

I'll skip the details on $E_4$ and $E_5$, but they are $E_4 =\Q((1-i)\a_1)$ and $E_5 = \Q(\sqrt{2},i)$.

$E_6$ has degree equal to $[G:H_6] = 2$ over $\Q$ and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of $L$ fixed by $\tau$. Since $\tau(i) = i$ (which can be seen by looking back at how we built $\tau$ originally or by noting that $\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i$), we get $E_6 = \Q(i)$.

I'll skip the details on $E_7$, but it is $E_7 = \Q(\sqrt{2})$.

$E_8$ also has degree two over $\Q$ and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of $H_8$. Note that $\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}$ and so $i \sqrt{2}$ is fixed by both $(1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)$ and $(1 \,4)(2 \, 3)$. Thus $E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})$.

Finally, we note that $G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8$ are normal subgroups of $D_8$, since $H_5$ is the center of $D_8$ and each of $H_6, H_7, H_8$ has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem
that $\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8$ are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over $\Q$. As an $\ex$, to see directly that $E_3$ is not Galois over $\Q$, note that $(1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}$ is a root of $x^4 + 4$, which is irreducible. But $(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}$ is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in $E_3$. We conclude from Proposition \ref{prop429} that $E_3$ is not a normal extension of $\Q$. 
#### $\ex$ – Cyclotomic Extensions Revisited
Let $F$ be a field, let $n$ be a positive integer such that $\char(F)$ does not divide $n$, and let $\ov{F}$ be the algebraic closure of $F$. If $\zeta\ov{F}$ is a primitive $n$-th root of 1 over $F$, then $F(\zeta)/F$ is a finite Galois extension, and $\Gal(F(\zeta)/F)$ is a cyclic group that is isomorphic to a subgroup of $(\Z/n,+)$.
#### $\rem$
If $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$ and $n$ is an integer that is divisible by $p$, then $x^n - 1$ is not separable.
#### $\ex$ – Two Complex Roots and $S_n$
Let $f$ be an irreducible, fifth degree polynomial in $\Q[x]$ with exactly three real roots and let $L$ be its splitting field over $\Q$. Let the real roots be $\a_1, \a_2, \a_3$ and the imaginary ones be $\a_4$ and $\a_5$. Then $G = \Gal(L/\Q)$ is isomorphic to $S_5$. You will prove this on one of the final exam problems (for a specific case), but let me get you started with a couple {\em tips}: Show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup $H$ of $S_5$ with $5 \mid \#H$. You may use (without justifying it) that if $\tau$ is a $2$-cycle in $S_5$ and $\s$ is any five cycle in $S_5$, then the subgroup of $S_5$ they generate is all of $S_5$.
#### $\ex$ – Finding Unique Intermediate Field
If $F \subseteq L$ is a finite Galois extension of degree $21$, then I claim there is a unique intermediate field $E$ with $[E:F] = 3$ and that $E$ must be a Galois extension over $F$.

To see this, set $G= \Gal(L/F)$. Then $\#G = 21 = 3 \cdot 7$ and by the Sylow theorems, there is a unique Sylow $7$-subgroup, call it $H$, and hence $H$ is normal in $G$. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that $E := L^H$ is an intermediate field that (a) is Galois over $F$ and (b) satisfies $[E: F] = [G :H] = 3$. Moreover, it is unique since $G$ has just one subgroup of index $3$. 

In fact, there are exactly two groups of order $21$ up to isomorphism, the cyclic one and one that is a (non-trivial) semi-direct product of $\Z/7$ by $\Z/3$. So, there are just two possible lattices of intermediate fields for such a field extension.
### Solvability
#### $\defn$ – Solvable by Radicals
![[Solvable by Radicals]]
#### $\rem$
It should be pointed out that $a_i = 1$ is allowed here, so that some
of the steps in this definitions may involve adjoining roots of unity.

Roughly speaking $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals if each of its roots can be written by a (perhaps extremely complicated) expression involving sums, products and iterated $n$-th roots of elements of $F$.
#### $\ex$ – Pre-Calc $\ex$
As every pre-calculus student should know, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \in \Q[x]$ is solvable by radicals. To see this, take $m=1$ and $F_1$ the splitting field of $x^2 - (b^2 - 4ac)$.
#### $\ex$ – Solvable Quadratic
$f(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c \in \Q[x]$ is solvable by radicals over $\Q$.
To see this, note that the roots of $f(x)$ are
$$
\pm \sqrt{\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}}.
$$
So, let $m = 3$, set $F_1$ to be the splitting field of $x^2 - (b^2 - 4ac)$ over $\Q$, $F_2$ to be the splitting field of $x^2 - \left(\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}\right)$ over $F_1$, and $F_3$ to be the splitting field of $x^2 - \left(\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}\right)$ over $F_2$. It is not clear if $F_3 = F_2$ or $F_2 \subset F_3$, but, either way, this gives a tower that shows that $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals.
#### $\defn$ – Solvable Group
