#### $\defn$ – Galois Extension
A [[Degree of Field Extension|finite]] [[Field Extension|extension]] of [[Field|fields]] is a *Galois* extension if the three equivalence conditions of this [[theorem – Galois Extension Equivalencies|theorem]] hold: 
1. $|\Aut(L/F)| = [L:F]$[^2]
2. The extension is both [[Normal Extension|normal]] and [[Separable|separable]].
3. $L$ is the [[Splitting Field|splitting field]] of some separable polynomial with coefficients in $F$. 

In this case it is customary to write $\Gal(L/F)$ for the [[Group|group]] $\Aut(L/F)$[^1] and to refer to it as the *Galois group* of the extension – they are exactly the same group, but the former is used only when the extension is Galois.
