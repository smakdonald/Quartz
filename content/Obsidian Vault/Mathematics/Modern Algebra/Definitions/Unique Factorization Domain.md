#### $\defn$ â€“ Unique Factorization Domain
A [[Ring|ring]] $R$ is called a *unique factorization domain*, or UFD for short, if $R$ is an [[Definitions#Integral Domain|integral domain]] and every element $r \in R$ that is non-zero and not a [[Unit|unit]] can be written as a finite product
$$r = p_1 \cdots p_n$$
of (not necessarily distinct) [[Mathematics/Modern Algebra/Definitions/Prime|irreducible]] elements $p_1, \dots, p_n$ of $R$ in a way that is unique up to ordering and [[Definitions#Associates|associates]]. That is, if
$$r = q_1 \cdots q_m$$
also holds with each $q_i$ irreducible, then $m = n$ and there is a [[Definitions#Permutation Group|permutation]] $\sigma$ such that, for all $i$, we have  $p_i$ and $q_{\sigma(i)}$ are associates.
