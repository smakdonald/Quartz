#### $\defn$ – Minimum Polynomial (Matrix)
Let $F$ be a [[Field|field]] and let $A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)$. The *minimum polynomial* of $A$, denoted $\mp_A(x)$, is the unique monic [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Ideal|generator]] of the [[Ideal|ideal]] $\{g(x) \in F[x] \, \mid \, g(A) = 0\}$. Equivalently, $\mp_A(x)$ is the monic polynomial of least [[Polynomial Degree|degree]] such that  $\mp_A(A) = 0$.

#### $\defn$ – Minimum Polynomial (Linear Transformation)
More generally, let $V$ be an $F$-[[Vector Space|vector space]] of [[Dim (Vector Space)|dimension]] $n$, and let $g: V \to V$ be a [[Linear Transformation|linear transformation]]. The *minimum polynomial* of $g$, denoted $\mp_g(x)$, is the unique monic polynomial [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Ideal|generating]] the ideal $\{f(x) \in F[x] \mid f(g) = 0\}$ or, equivalently, the [[Annihilator|annihilator]] ideal ${\ann}_{F[x]}(V_g)$.

#### $\defn$ – Minimum Polynomial (Element)
If $\a \in L$ is [[Algebraic Element|algebraic]] over the [[Subring|subfield]] $F$, the unique monic generator of the ideal $I$ in the previous theorem, written $m_{\a, F}(x)$, is called the *minimum polynomial* of $\a$ over $F$.
