#### $\defn$ – Dimension
The *dimension* of a [[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$, denoted $\dim_F(V)$ or $\dim(V)$, is the cardinality of any of its [[Basis and Free Module|bases]]. This is the same as the *rank* of $V$ as an $F$-[[Module|module]].

#### $\defn$ – Finite Dimensional
An $F$-[[Vector Space|vector space]] is *finite dimensional* if it is [[Generator|finitely generated]] as a [[Module|module]]; that is, if there is  a finite subset that spans it. Thanks to this [[Corollary – Every Vector Space has a Basis|Corollary]], this is equivalent to the property that it has a finite [[Basis and Free Module|basis]].
