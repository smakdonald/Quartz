#### $\defn$ â€“ Euclidean Domain
A *Euclidean domain* (ED) is a [[Integral Domain|domain]] $R$ together with a function $N: R \to \Z_{\geq 0}$ such that $N(0) = 0$ and the following property holds: for any two elements $a, b \in R$ with  $b \ne 0$, there are elements $q$ and $r$ of $R$ such that
$$
a = qb + r \text{ and either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(b)$.}
$$
