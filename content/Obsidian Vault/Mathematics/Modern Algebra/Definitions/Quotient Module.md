#### $\defn$ â€“ Quotient Module
Let $R$ be a [[Ring|ring]], let $M$ be an R-[[Module|module]], and let $N$ be a [[Submodule|submodule]] of $M$. The *quotient module* $M/N$ is the [[Quotient Group|quotient]] [[Group|group]] $M/N$ under $+$ (so elements of $M/N$ are additive [[Coset|cosets]] of the form $m + N$ with $m \in M$ and addition is defined by $(m_1 + N) + (m_2 + N) = (m_1+m_2) + N$) and with the rule for scaling by $R$ defined to be 
$$r \cdot (m + N) = rm + N$$
for all $r \in R$ and $m + N \in M/N$.
