#### $\defn$ – Separable Polynomial
Let $F$ be a [[Field|field]] and $f(x)$ a polynomial in $F[x]$[^1]. If the [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]] of every root is $1$, we say $f(x)$ is a *separable* polynomial; i.e. $f$ is separable provided it has no repeated roots. 

#### $\defn$ – Separable Field Extension
An [[Algebraic Extension|algebraic]] [[Field|field]] [[Field Extension|extension]] $F \subseteq L$ is called *separable* if for every $\a \in L$ its [[Minimum Polynomial|minimum polynomial]] $m_{\a, F}(x)$ is [[Multiplicity|separable]] (i.e., has no repeated roots in an algebraic closure of $F$).
