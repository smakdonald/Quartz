#### $\defn$ – Content
For a [[Principal Ideal Domain|PID]] $R$ and $f \in R[x]$[^1], define the *content* of $f$, written $\cont(f)$, to be the [[GCD|GCD]] of the coefficients of $f$. Equivalently, $\cont(f)$ is the [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generator|generator]] of the [[Principal Ideal|principle]] [[Ideal|ideal]] [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Ideal|generated]] by the coefficients of $f$.
