#### $\defn$ – Isomorphism
1. A [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $f: G \to H$ is called an *isomorphism* if there exists a homomorphism $g: H \to G$ such that $f \circ g = \id_H$ and $g \circ f = \id_G$. If $f:G\to H$ is an isomorphism, $G$ and $H$ are called *isomorphic*, written $G\cong H$.
2. A function $f:G\to H$ between two [[Group|groups]] is an isomorphism if and only if $f$ is a bijective homomorphism.

#### $\defn$ – $R$-Module Isomorphism
An $R$-[[Module|module]] homomorphism $h: M \to N$ is an $R$-module *isomorphism* if there is another $R$-module homomorphism $g: N \to M$ such that $h \circ g = \id_M$ and $g \circ h = \id_N$.

#### $\defn$ – Ring Isomorphism
A [[Ring|ring]] [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $f: R \to S$ that is bijective is called a *ring isomorphism*. 
Two rings $R$ and $S$ are *isomorphic*, written $R \cong S$, if there is an isomorphism from $R$ to $S$.
