#### $\defn$ – Invariant Factor
In Theorem \ref{thm:FTFGAGinvfact}, the number $r$ is the *rank* of $G$, the numbers $n_1,\ldots,n_t$ are the *invariant factors* of $G$, and the decomposition of $G$ in part (1) is the *invariant factor decomposition* of $G$.

#### $\defn$ – Invariant Factors 
The polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_s$ occurring in the Theorem are called the {\em invariant factors} of the operator $g$.

With the notation of the Theorem, the integer $r$ is called the {\em rank} of $M$ and the elements $d_1,\dots,d_k$ are the {\em invariant factors} of $M$.
