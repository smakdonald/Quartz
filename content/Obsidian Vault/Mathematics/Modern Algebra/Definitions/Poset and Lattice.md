#### $\defn$ â€“ Poset and Lattice
An *order relation* is a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] that is reflexive, antisymmetric ($a\leq b$ and $b\leq a$ imply $a=b$) and transitive. A *partially ordered set* (poset) is a pair $(S,\leq)$ where $S$ is a set endowed with an order relation $\leq$. A *lattice* is a poset in which every two elements have a unique supremum and a unique infimum defined as follows:
$$\sup(a,b) = \text{ smallest } c \text{ such that } a\leq c \text{ and } b\leq c$$
$$\inf(a,b) = \text{ largest } c \text{ such that } c\leq a \text{ and } c\leq b.$$
