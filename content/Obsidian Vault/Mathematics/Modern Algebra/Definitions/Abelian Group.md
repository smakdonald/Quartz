#### $\defn$ â€“ Abelian Group
A [[Group|group]] $G$ is an *abelian group* if $\cdot$ is commutative; i.e., $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$ for all $x,y \in G.$ Often, but not always, the group [[Binary Operation|operation]] for an abelian group is written as $+$ instead of $\cdot$. In this case the inverse of an element $x$ is written $-x$.
