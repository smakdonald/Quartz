#### $\defn$ â€“ Elementary Row Operations
Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] with $1 \neq 0$. An *elementary row (column) operation* on a matrix $A \in \Mat_{m,n}(R)$ is one of the following three types of operations: 
1. (Type I) Adding an element of $R$ times a row (column) of $A$ to a different row column of $A$. 
2. (Type II) Multiplying a row (column) of $A$ by a [[Unit|unit]] of $R$.
3. (Type III) Interchanging two rows (columns) of $A$.
