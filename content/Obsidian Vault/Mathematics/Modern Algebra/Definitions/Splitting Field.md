#### $\defn$ â€“ Splitting Field
For a [[Ring|field]] $F$ and non-constant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$[^1], a *splitting field* of $f(x)$ over $F$ is a field [[Field Extension|extension]] $F \subseteq L$ such that 
1. $f(x)$ *splits* completely into linear factors in $L[x]$; that is, $f(x) = c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)$ for some $c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in L$, and
2. $L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)$; that is, $L$ is the smallest [[Subring|subfield]] of $L$ that contains $F$ and all the roots of $f(x)$.
