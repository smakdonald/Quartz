#### $\defn$ â€“ Coset
Let $H$ be a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of a [[Group|group]] $G$. The *left action* of $H$ on $G$ is given by $h\cdot g=hg$ for any $h\in H, g\in G$. The *equivalence relation* $\sim_H$ on $G$ induced by the left [[Group Action|action]] of $H$ is given by $$g \sim_H g' \text{ if and only if } g' = hg \text{ for some }n \in H.$$
The equivalence class of $g \in G$, also called the [[Orbit|orbit]] of $g$, and also called the *right coset* of $H$ in $G$ containing $g$ is
$$Hg = \{hg \mid h \in H\}.$$ 
There is also a *left coset* of $H$ in $G$ containing $g$ defined by
$$gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\}.$$
