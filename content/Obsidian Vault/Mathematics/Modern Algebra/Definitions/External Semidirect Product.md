#### $\defn$ â€“ External Semidirect Product
Let $H$ and $K$ be [[Group|groups]] and let $\rho:K\to \Aut(H)$[^1] be a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]]. The (external) *semidirect product* induced by $\rho$ is the set $H \times K$ with the [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] defined by  $$(h,k)(h',k') = (h\rho(k)(h'),kk').$$This group is denoted by $H \sdp_\rho K$.
