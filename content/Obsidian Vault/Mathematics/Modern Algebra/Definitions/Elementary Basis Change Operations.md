#### $\defn$ â€“ Elementary Basis Change Operations
Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] with $1 \neq 0$, let $M$ be a [[Basis and Free Module|free]] $R$-[[Module|module]] of finite [[Rank|rank]] $n$, and let $B = \{b_1,\dots ,b_n\}$ be an ordered [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] for $M$. An *elementary basis change operation* on the basis $B$ is one of the following three types of operations: 
1. (Type I) Replacing $b_i$ by $b_i + rb_j$ for some $i \neq j$ and some $r\in R$.
2. (Type II) Replacing $b_i$ by $ub_i$ for some $i$ and some [[Unit|unit]] $u$ of $R$,
3. (Type III) Swapping the positions of $b_i$ and $b_j$ for some $i \neq j$.
