#### $\defn$ – Root Multiplicity
For a [[Ring|field]] $F$ and a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$[^1], let $\ov{F}$ be an [[Algebraic Closure|algebraic closure]] of $F$ and $\a \in \ov{F}$ a root of $f(x)$. The *multiplicity* of $\a$ in $f$ is the number of times $(x - \a)$ appears in the factorization $f(x) = c \prod_i (x - \a_i)$ of $f$ in $\ov{F}[x]$. (This number is independent of choice of  algebraic closure by uniqueness of such closures up to [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]].[^2])
