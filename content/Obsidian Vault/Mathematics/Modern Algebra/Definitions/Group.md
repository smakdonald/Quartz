#### $\defn$ – Group
A *group* is a pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a set and $\cdot$ is a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] on $G$ called group multiplication, satisfying the following properties:
1. (Associativity) for all $x,y,z\in G$ we have $(x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot (y\cdot z)$ 
2. (Identity Element) there exists $e\in G$ such that $e·x=x·e=x$ for all $x\in G$
3. (Inverses) for each $x\in G$, there is an element $y\in G$ such that $xy=e=yx$.
