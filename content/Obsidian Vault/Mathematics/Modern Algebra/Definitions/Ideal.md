#### $\defn$ – Ideal
For a [[Ring|ring]] $R$, an *ideal* (or a *two sided ideal*) of $R$ is a non empty subset $I$ such that
1. $(I,+)$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $(R,+)$ and
2. for all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$, we have $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$ (we can write this concisely as for all $r \in R,$ $rI\subseteq I$ and $Ir\subseteq I$ ). This is often called *absorption*.

#### $\defn$ – Proper Ideal
For a [[Ring|ring]] $R$, a *proper* ideal is an ideal $I$ such that $I\neq R$.
