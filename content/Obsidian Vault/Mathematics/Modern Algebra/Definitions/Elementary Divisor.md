#### $\defn$ – Elementary Divisor
In [[Theorem – FTFGAG Elementary Divisor form]] the $p_i^{a_{i,k}}$ are the *elementary divisors* of $G$ and the decomposition of $G$ in parts (1--2) is called the *elementary divisor decomposition* of $G.$ The decomposition in part (1) is also called a *primary decomposition*.
