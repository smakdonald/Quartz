#### $\defn$ – Center (Ring)
The *center* of a [[Ring|ring]] $R$ is the set $$Z(R)=\{z \in R \mid zr = rz \text{ for all }r \in R\}.$$
#### $\defn$ – Center (Group)
The *center* of a [[Group|group]] $G$, often written $Z(G)$, is the set of elements of $G$ that commute with every element of $G$. That is, $$Z(G)=\{x \in G \, | \, xy = yx\,\text{ for all $y \in G$}\}.$$
