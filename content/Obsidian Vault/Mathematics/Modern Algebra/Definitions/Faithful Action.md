#### $\defn$ â€“ Faithful Action
An [[Group Action|action]] of a [[Group|group]] $G$ on a set $S$ is called *faithful* if the associated group [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] is injective. Equivalently, an action is faithful if and only if for a given $g \in G$, whenever $g \cdot s = s$ for all $s \in S$, it must be that $g = e_G$.
