#### $\defn$ â€“ Order
In a [[Group|group]] $G$, the *order* of an element $x$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $x^n = e$. If no such $n$ exists, we say $x$ has infinite order. We write $|x|$ for the order of $x$. 

The order of a group $G$ is the cardinality of the set $G$, denoted $|G|$. If $|G|<\infty$ we say $G$ is *finite*.
