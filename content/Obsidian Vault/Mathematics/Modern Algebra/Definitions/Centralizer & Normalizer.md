#### $\defn$ – Centralizer
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]]. For any $g \in G$,
$$C_G(g):= \{x \in G \mid gx = xg\}$$
is called the *centralizer* of $g$ in $G$.

#### $\defn$ – Normalizer
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]]. For any $S \subseteq G$,
$$N_G(S):= \{g \in G \mid gSg^{-1}=S\}$$
is called the *normalizer* of $S$ in $G$.
