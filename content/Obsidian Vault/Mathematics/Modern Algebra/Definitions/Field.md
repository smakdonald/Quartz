#### $\defn$ â€“ Field
A [[Ring|ring]] $R$ is a *field* if it is a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Division Ring|division]] ring.

More specifically, A field is a set $\F$  together with definitions of $+$ and $\times$ (in other words, together with functions $+,\times:\F\times \F \to \F$) such all the following properties hold:
- Addition is commutative: for all $x, y\in \F$ we have $x+y=y+x$
- Addition is associative: for all $x, y, z\in \F$ we have $x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z$
- There is an additive identity: there is a special number $0\in \F$ such that for all $x\in \F$ we have $0+x = x$
- There are additive inverses: for all $x\in \F$ there is an element that we denote $-x$ such that $x+(-x)=0$.
- Multiplication is commutative: for all $x, y\in \F$ we have $x y=y x$
- Multiplication is associative: for all $x, y\in \F$ we have $x(y z)=(x y)z$
- There is a multiplicative identity: there is a special number $1\in \F$ such that for all $x\in \F$ we have $1x = x$
- There are multiplicative inverse for non-zero numbers: for all $x\in \F\setminus\set{0}$ there is an element that we denote $x\inv$ such that $xx\inv=1$
