#### $\defn$ – Multiplicatively Closed Set
Suppose $R$ is a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] and $S \subseteq R$ is a subset such that
1. $1 \in S$,
2. $S$ is closed under multiplication (i.e., if $x,y \in S$, then $xy \in S$), and
3. $S$ does not contain $0$ nor any [[Zero-Divisor|zero-divisors]].
Such a subset $S$ is called a *multiplicatively closed subset of non zero divisors* of $R$.

#### $\defn$ – Multiplicatively Closed
A subset $W\subseteq R$ of a ring $R$ is *multiplicatively closed* if $1\in W$ and $a,b\in W \Rightarrow ab\in W$.
