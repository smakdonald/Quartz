#### $\defn$ – Sylow $p$-Subgroup
Let $G$ be a [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] and $p$ a prime. Write the [[Order|order]] of $G$ as  $|G| = p^e m$ where  $p \nmid m$.
A *Sylow $p$-subgroup* of $G$ is a [[Definitions#Subgroup|subgroup]] $H \leq G$ such that $|H| = p^e$. That is, a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is a subgroup whose order is the highest conceivable power of $p$ according to [[Theorem – Lagrange's Theorem|Lagrange's Theorem]]. 

We set $\Syl_p(G)$ to be the collection of all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ and $n_p=|\Syl_p(G)|$ to be the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups.
