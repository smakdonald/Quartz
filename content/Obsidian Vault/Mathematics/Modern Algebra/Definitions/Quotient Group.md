#### $\defn$ – Quotient Group
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and let $\sim$ be an [[Equivalence Relation|equivalence relation]] on $G$ that is [[Compatible with Addition & Multiplication|compatible with multiplication]]. The *quotient group* is the set $G/\sim$ of [[Equivalence Class|equivalence classes]], with group multiplication $[x]\cdot [y] = [xy]$. (This is a group by Proposition #fix .)

#### $\defn$ – Quotient Group
For any [[Normal Subgroup|normal]] [[Subgroup|subgroup]] $N$ of a [[Group|group]] $G$, the *quotient group* $G/N$ is $G/\sim_N$, where $\sim_N$ is the equivalence relation induced by the [[Group Action|left action]] of $N$ on $G$. In other words, $G/N$ is the set of left [[Coset|cosets]] of $N$ in $G$ with multiplication given by $xN\cdot yN=(xy)N$.
