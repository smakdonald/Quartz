#### $\defn$ â€“ Fixed Subfields
For a [[Field|field]] $L$ and a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] $G$ of $\Aut(L)$[^1], the *subfield of $L$ fixed* by $G$, denoted $L^G$, is by definition
$$
L^G := \{ \a \in L \mid \s(\a) = \a, \text{ for all }\s \in G\}.
$$
$L^G$ really is a [[Subring|subfield]] of $L$ since $L^G = \bigcap_{\s \in G} L^\s$ where $L^\s = \{\a \in L \mid \s(\a) = \a\}$, and we proved before that $L^\s$ is a subfield of $L$.
