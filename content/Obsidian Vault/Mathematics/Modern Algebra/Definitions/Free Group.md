#### $\defn$ â€“ Free Group
Let $A$ be a set. Consider a new set of symbols $A^{-1}=\{a^{-1} \mid a \in A\}$. The *free group* on $A$, denoted $F(A)$, is the set of all finite words written using symbols in $A\cup A^{-1}$, including the empty word, where two words are equal if one is obtained from the other by erasing a pair of consecutive symbols $aa^{-1}$ or $a^{-1}a$. 
In symbols,
$$F(A)=\{a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2}\cdots a_m^{i_m} \mid m\geq 0, a_j\in A, i_j\in\{-1,1\}\}.$$
The set $F(A)$ is a [[Group|group]] in which any two words are [[Binary Operation|multiplied]] by concatenation.
