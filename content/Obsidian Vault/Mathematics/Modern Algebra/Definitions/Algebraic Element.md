#### $\defn$ – Algebraic (Element)
For a [[Field|field]] [[Field Extension|extension]] $F \subseteq L$ and $\a \in L$, we say $\a$ is *algebraic* over $F$ if $f(\a) = 0$ for some non-zero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$[^1]. Otherwise, $\a$ is *transcendental* over $F$.

#### $\defn$ – Algebraic (Number)
A number $\a \in\C$[^1] is *algebraic* if there exists a monic polynomial $f \in\Q[x]$ such 
that $f (\a ) = 0$. The *degree* of an algebraic number is the smallest degree of any 
such polynomial, which is called a *minimal polynomial* for $\a$. A number that is 
not algebraic is called *transcendental*.
