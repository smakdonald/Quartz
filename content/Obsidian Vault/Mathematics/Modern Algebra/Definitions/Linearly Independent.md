#### $\defn$ â€“ Linearly (In)Dependent
Let $M$ be an $R$-[[Module|module]] and let $A$ be a subset of $M$. The set $A$ is *linearly independent* if whenever $r_1,\ldots,r_n \in R$ and $a_1,\ldots ,a_n$ are distinct elements of $A$ satisfying $r_1a_1 + \dots + r_na_n = 0$, then $r_1 = \dots = r_n = 0$. Equivalently, $A$ is linearly independent if and only if given any equation of the form $\sum_a r_a a = 0$ where $r_a \in R$ for all $a \in A$ and $r_a = 0$ for all but a finite number of $a'$s, we must have $r_a = 0$ for all $a$. 

Otherwise $A$ is *linearly dependent*. So, $A$ is linearly dependent if and only if there is an equation of the form $\sum_a r_a a = 0$ where $r_a \in R$ for all $a \in A$, $r_a = 0$ for all but a finite number of $a'$s, and $r_a \ne 0$ for at least one $a$.
