#### $\defn$ – Direct Product, Sum
Let $G_\a$ be a [[Group|group]] for all $\a$ in an index set $J$. The *direct product* of the groups $G_\a$ is the Cartesian product $\prod_{\a\in J} G_\a$ with [[Binary Operation|multiplication]] defined by $$(g_a)_{\a \in  J}(h_\a)_{\a \in J} = (g_\a h_\a)_{\a \in J}.$$

#### $\defn$ – Direct Sum
The *direct sum* of the groups $G_\a$ is the subset $\bigoplus_{\a\in J} G_\a$ of the direct product $\prod_{\a\in J} G_\a$ given by $$\bigoplus_{\a\in J} G_\a= \{(g_\a)_{\a \in J} \mid  g_\a = e_{G_\a} \text{ for all but finitely many } \a\},$$ with the same multiplication as the direct product.
