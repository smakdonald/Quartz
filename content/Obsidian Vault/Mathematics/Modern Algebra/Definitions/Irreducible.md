#### $\defn$ – Irreducible
Suppose $R$ is a [[Integral Domain|domain]]. An element $r \in R$ is *irreducible* if $r\neq 0$, $r$ is not a [[Unit|unit]], and whenever $r = xy$ with $x,y \in R$ then either $x$ or $y$ is a unit.

#### $\defn$ – Irreducible Polynomial
For an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]] $R$, a polynomial $p(x) \in R[x][^1]$ is called *irreducible* if $p(x)$ is not a [[Unit|unit]] and whenever $p(x) = f(x) g(x)$, either $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ is a unit. (It follows that such a $p(x)$ also cannot be $0$.)
