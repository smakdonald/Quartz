#### $\defn$ – Automorphism
An *automorphism* of $G$ is a [[Group|group]] [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] $f:G\to G$. The set of all automorphisms of $G$ is denoted $\Aut(G)$.

#### $\defn$ – Field Automorphism Group
Let $K$ be a [[Ring|field]]. The *automorphism group* of $K$, written $\Aut(K)$, is the collection of field automorphisms of $K$, with the [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] of composition. 

The *automorphism group* of a field [[Field Extension|extension]] $F \subseteq K$, written $\Aut(K/F)$, is the [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $\Aut(K)$ consisting of those field automorphisms of $K$ that [[Restriction|restrict]] to the [[Identity Map|identity]] on $F$.
