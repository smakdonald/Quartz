#### $\defn$ â€“ Conjugacy Class
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]]. Two elements $g,g' \in G$ are *conjugate* if there is $h \in G$ with $g' = hgh^{-1}$ (equivalently $g$ and $g'$ are in the same [[Orbit|orbit]] of the conjugation [[Group Action|action]]). 

The *conjugacy class* of an element $g \in G$ is $[g]_c = \{hgh^{-1} \mid h \in G\}$, i.e. the orbit of $g$ under conjugation.

Two subsets $S,S' \subseteq G$ are conjugate if there is $h \in G$ with $S' = hSh^{-1}$.
