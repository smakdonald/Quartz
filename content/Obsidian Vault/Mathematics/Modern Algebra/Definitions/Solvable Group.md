#### $\defn$ â€“ Solvable Group
A [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] $G$ is called *solvable* if there exists a sequence of [[Subgroup|subgroups]] $$\{e\}=N_0 \leq N_1 \leq \ldots \leq N_k = G$$ such that for each $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$, we have that $N_{i-1}$ is a [[Normal Subgroup|normal]] subgroup of $N_{i}$ (that is, $N_{i-1} \nsg N_{i}$) and that the [[Quotient Group|quotient]] group $N_{i}/N_{i-1}$ is abelian. 

Equivalently, $G$ is solvable if and only if each of its [[Simple Group|simple]] composition factors is [[Cyclic|cyclic]] of prime order.
