#### $\defn$ – Cyclic Group
If $G$ is a [[Generator|generated]] by a single element, i.e. $G=\langle x \rangle$ for some $x \in G$, then $G$ is called a *cyclic group.*
***
#### $\defn$ – Cyclic Module
If $M = R \cdot a$[^1] for some single element $a \in M$, we say that $M$ is *cyclic*.  
***
#### $\defn$ – Infinite and Finite Cyclic Groups
The *infinite cyclic group* is the [[Group|group]] $C_\infty = \{x^i | i \in \Z\}$ with multiplication $x^ix^j = x^{i+j}$. For any natural number $n$, *the cyclic group of order* $n$ is the group $C_n = \{x^i | i \in \{0,\dots,n-1\}\}$ with multiplication $x^ix^j = x^{i+j \pmod n}$.
