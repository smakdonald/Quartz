#### $\defn$ â€“ Ring of Fractions
If $R$ is a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] and $S$ is a [[Definitions#Multiplicatively Closed Set|multiplicatively closed]] subset of non-[[Zero-Divisor|zerodivisors]], the *ring of fractions* $S^{-1}R$ (also called the *localization* of $R$ at $S$) is the set of equivalence classes 
$$S^{-1}R=\left\{\frac{r}{s} \mid r\in R,s\in S\right\}/\sim$$ where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is defined by $$\frac{r}{s}\sim\frac{r'}{s'} \text{ if and only if } rs'=r's.$$ 
From now on we just write $=$ instead of $\sim$ when dealing with fractions.

Addition and multiplication on $S^{-1}R$ are given by $$\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} = \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'} \text{ and } \frac{r}{s} \cdot \frac{r'}{s'} = \frac{rr'}{ss'}.$$
