#### $\defn$ â€“ Polynomial Degree
Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] with $1\neq 0$. The *degree* of a nonzero polynomial $$f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i\in R[x]$$[^1] with $a_n \ne 0$ is defined to be $n$. The $0$ polynomial does not have a degree.

#### Polynomial Degree
The *degree* of a nonzero polynomial $f=\sum\limits_{e_1, \dots, e_n \in \Z_{\geq 0}} r_{e_1, \dots, e_n} x_1^{e_1} x_2^{e_2} \cdots x_n^{e_n}$ is $$\deg(f)=\max\{e_1+\dots+e_n \mid r_{e_1,\dots, e_n}\neq 0\}.$$
