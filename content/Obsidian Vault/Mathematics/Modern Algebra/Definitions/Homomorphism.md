#### $\defn$ – Homomorphism
If $G$ and $H$ are [[Group|groups]], a *homomorphism* from $G$  is $H$ is a function $f: G \to H$ such that $f(x \cdot_G y) = f(x)\cdot_H f(y)$, where $\cdot_G$ and $\cdot_H$ denote the [[Binary Operation|multiplication]] rules for $G$ and $H$, respectively. We call this property *operation preserving*.

#### $\defn$ – $R$-Module Homomorphism
Let $R$ be a [[Ring|ring]] and let $M$ and $N$ be $R$-[[Module|modules]]. An $R$-module *homomorphism* from $M$ to $N$, sometimes called an $R$-*map*, is a function $h: M \to N$ such that for all $r \in R$ and $m,n \in M$ we have 
1. $h(m+n)=h(m)+h(n)$, i.e. $h$ is an additive [[Homomorphism|group homomorphism]], and
2. $h(rm) = rh(m)$.

#### $\defn$ – Ring Homomorphism
If $R$ and $S$ are [[Ring|rings]], a *ring homomorphism* from $R$ to $S$ is a function $f: R \to S$ that satisfies:
1. $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all $x,y \in R$,
2. $f(x \cdot y) = f(x) \cdot f(y)$ for all $x,y \in R$.
