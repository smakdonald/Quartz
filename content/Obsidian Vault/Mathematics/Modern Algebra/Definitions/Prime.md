#### $\defn$ – Prime (Domain)
Suppose $R$ is a [[Integral Domain|domain]]. An element $p \in R$ is a *prime* element if $p \neq 0$ and the [[Ideal|ideal]] $(p)$ is a [[Mathematics/Modern Algebra/Definitions/Prime Ideal|prime]] ideal.

#### $\defn$ – Prime (Gaussian)
Let $\pi \in\Z[i]$ be a Gaussian integer that is neither zero nor a unit. We say $\pi$ is 
prime (and hence a Gaussian prime) if its only divisors are units and associates 
of $\pi$; otherwise, $\pi$ is composite.

#### $\defn$ – Prime (Integer)
Let $p$ be an integer greater than $1$. The number $p$ is a *prime* number if the only positive integers that [[Divides|divide]] $p$ are $1$ and $p$. 

#### $\defn$ – Composite
The number $p$ is a *composite* number if it is not a prime number.
