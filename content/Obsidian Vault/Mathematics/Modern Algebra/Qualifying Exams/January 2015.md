### Problem 8 #unfinished
Consider the following matrix:
$$A=\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 & 0\\0 & 2 & 0\\2 & 1 & -1\end{bmatrix}.$$
(a) Find the rational canonical form of $A$.
(b) Find the Jordan canonical form of $A$.

##### *Proof*.

###### Part (a)
First, note that $\cp_A(x)=\det(A-xI)$, and thus $\cp_A(x)=\begin{bmatrix} -1-x & 3 & 0\\0 & 2-x & 0\\2 & 1 & -1-x\end{bmatrix}.$

### Problem 9 #unfinished
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity (with $1\neq0$) and $I$ a proper ideal. Prove there exists a prime ideal $p$ containing $I$ such that whenever $p ⊇ q ⊇ I$ where $q$ is also a prime ideal, then $p = q$. (Hint: use Zorn’s lemma.)

##### *Proof*.
