## Section I: Group theory
Solve two of the following three problems.  
### Problem 1 – Subgroup of Squares and Cosets
[[Problem – Subgroup of Squares and Cosets]]
### Problem 2 #unfinished
Construct a nonabelian [[Group|group]] of [[Order|order]] $21$ and give a [[Presentation|presentation]] for your group  
(with justification).

##### *Proof*.
First, we know that $G=C_{21}$ is a group of order $21$. By [[Theorem – Cauchy's Theorem|Cauchy's Theorem]], as $3$ and $7$ are primes dividing the order of $G$ there exist elements $k,h$ of orders $3$, $7$, respectively. Consider $K=\langle k\rangle$ and $H=\langle h\rangle$, both of which are subgroups of $C_{21}$. By [[Theorem – Lagrange's Theorem|Lagrange's Theorem]] we see $[C_{21}:H]=3$ (See: [[Index]]), the smallest prime dividing $21$, making $H$ [[Normal Subgroup|normal]] in $G.$ Thus $HK\leq G$, but as $K\cap H=\{e\}$ we have $|HK|=21=|G|$ and thus that $HK=G$. By the [[Proposition – Recognition Theorem Internal Semidirect Products|Recognition Theorem]] we have $H\sdp_\rho K\cong G$, where $\rho:K\to\Aut(H)$ is the [[Proposition – Permutation Representation|permutation representation]] of the [[Group Action|action]] of $K$ on $H$ via automorphisms given by conjugation in $G$.
