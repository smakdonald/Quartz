### Problem 6 #unfinished 
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $J = J_{2n}(0)$ be the Jordan block matrix of size $2n \times 2n$ with eigenvalue 0 in $M_{2n\times2n}(\C)$.

(a) Find the minimal polynomials for $J$ and for $J^2$, with justification.
(b) Find the Jordan canonical form of $J^2$, with justification. 
*Hint*: consider the kernel of $J^2$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $J = J_{2n}(0)$ be the Jordan block matrix of size $2n \times 2n$ with eigenvalue 0 in $M_{2n\times2n}(\C)$.

###### Part (a)
Notice that $J$ is a triangular matrix with $0$'s along the diagonal. Thus $\cp_J(x)=x^{2n}$, the product of the diagonal entries of the matrix $J-xI$. 

Squaring a triangular matrix moves everything one down (Proof?), and so $x^{2n-1}$ should do it. Squaring $J$ just moves us one closer, so $x^{2n-2}$

###### Part (b)
As $\cp_{J^2}(x)=x^{2n}$, the only roots of it are $0$, and thus these are the only elementary divisors of $J^2$.

[[Problem – When Set of Algebraic Elements Closed]]
### Problem 8 #unfinished
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be a prime integer. Consider the polynomial $$q(x) =x^{p^n}-x \in(\Z/p)[x]$$and define $K$ to be the splitting field of $q$ over $\Z/p$.

(a) Show that the set $E$ of roots of $q(x)$ in $K$ is a subfield of $K$.
(b) Show that $K$ has exactly $p^n$ elements.

##### *Proof.*
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be a prime integer. Consider the polynomial $$q(x) =x^{p^n}-x \in(\Z/p)[x]$$and define $K$ to be the splitting field of $q$ over $\Z/p$.

###### Part (a)
Let $E$ denote the set of roots of $q(x)$. Let $\a\in E$. Thus $\a^{p^n}-\a=0$. By the Factor Theorem there can be at most $p^n$ roots. Suppose $\a=\b$ for roots $\a,\b$.
