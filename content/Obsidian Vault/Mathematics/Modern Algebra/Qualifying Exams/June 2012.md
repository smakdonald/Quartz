### Problem 2 #unfinished

(b) Prove that if $G$ is [[Generator|finitely generated]], there are most finitely many subgroups with index $n$.

### Problem 4 #unfinished
Let $V$ be a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space, $W$. Recall that a subspace $U$ of $W$ is called a *complement* of $V$ if $U\oplus V = W$.

### Problem 7 #unfinished 
Let $R$ be a commutative integral domain and $K$ its field of fractions. Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of $R$, such that $(a) \cap(b) = (ab)$. Let $f : R[x] \to K$ be the unique ring homomorphism with $f (r) = \frac{r}{1}$ for $r \in R$ and $f (x) = \frac{b}{a}$. Prove that a polynomial $p(x) \in R[x]$ satisfies $f(p(x))=0$ if and only if $p(x) = (ax - b)q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x) \in R[x]$. (Hint: one way is to use induction on deg(p(x)).)
