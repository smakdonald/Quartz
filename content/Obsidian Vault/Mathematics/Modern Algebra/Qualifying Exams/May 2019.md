### Problem 7 #unfinished
Let $E, K,$ and $L$ be subfields of a field $F$ with $E \subseteq K$ and $E \subseteq L$. Let $k = [K : E]$ and $\ell = [L : E]$. Recall that $KL$ denotes the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of $F$ which satisfies $K\subseteq KL$ and $L\subseteq KL$.

(a) Show that $[KL : E] \leq k\ell$.
(b) Show that if $\gcd(k,\ell) = 1$ then $[KL : E] = k\ell.$
(c) Give an example satisfying $[KL : E] < k\ell$

##### *Proof.*
Let $E, K,$ and $L$ be subfields of a field $F$ with $E \subseteq K$ and $E \subseteq L$. Let $k = [K : E]$ and $\ell = [L : E]$.

###### Part (a)
We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see $[KL : E] = k\ell$ when $\gcd(k,\ell) = 1$. This is the largest possible size of $KL$, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus $[KL : E] \leq k\ell$
***
###### Part (b)
Suppose $\gcd(k,\ell) = 1$. As $K$ and $L$ are finite extensions of $E$ they are also algebraic. Thus there exists $\a\in K$ and $\b\in L$ such that $\mp_\a(x)$ has degree $k$ and $\mp_\b(x)$ has degree $\ell$. 

Thus $\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1$, making $\mp_\a(x)$ irreducible in $L[x]$. Thus $[L(\a):L]=k$. Notice that $E(\a,\b)=KL$, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of $F$ which satisfies $K\subseteq KL$ and $L\subseteq KL$. Thus we have $[KL:E]=k\ell$, as desired.
***
###### Part (c)
Let $E=\Q$, $L=K=\Q(\sqrt2)$, and $F=\Q(\sqrt2,i)$
Notice that $KL=K=L$, and thus $[KL:E]=[L:E]=\ell<\ell^2=k\ell$.
