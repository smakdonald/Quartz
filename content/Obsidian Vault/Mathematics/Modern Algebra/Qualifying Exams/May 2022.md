[[Problem – June 2012 (3)]]
### Problem 2 #unfinished
A non-abelian group of order $27$.  
(a) Prove there exists a non-abelian group of $27$. (Hint: Use a semi-direct product.) 
(b) Find, with justification, a presentation of the group you found in part (a).  

##### *Proof.*

### Problem 5 #unfinished
Prove the Rank-Nullity Theorem: If $F$ is a field, $V$ and $W$ are a finite dimensional $F$ -vector spaces, and $g : V \to W$ is an $F$ -linear transformation, then $$\rank(g) + \nullity(g) = \dim(V). $$(Recall the *rank* of $g$ is the dimension of its image and the nullity of $g$ is the dimension of its kernel.) 

##### *Proof*.
