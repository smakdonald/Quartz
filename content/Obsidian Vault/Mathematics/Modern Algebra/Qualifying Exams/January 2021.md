### Problem 5 #unfinished
Let $R$ be an integral domain and let $M$ be an $R$-module. Recall that a subset $S$ of $M$  
is *linearly independent* if whenever $∑_i r_is_i = 0$ for ring elements $r_i$ and elements $s_i ∈ S$, we must have $r_i = 0$ for all $i$. We say $S$ is *maximally linearly independent* if it is linearly independent and it is not properly contained in a linear independent subset of $M$ . Finally, recall that we say an $R$-module $P$ is torsion if for all $p ∈ P , rp = 0$ for some non-zero  $r\in R$.

(a) Suppose $S$ is a linearly independent subset of $M$ and let $N$ be the submodule  
of $M$ generated by $S$. Prove it is maximally linearly independent if and only if $M/N$  
is torsion.
(b) Prove that if for every module $M$ every maximally independent subset of $M$ generates $M$ as an $R$-module, then $R$ must be a field.

Solve two of the following three problems.
### Problem 7 #unfinished
On canonical forms
(a) Consider the $\Q[x]$-module
$$M=\frac{\Q[x]}{(x^4-1)}\oplus\frac{\Q[x]}{x^2(x-1)}$$
and let $V$ the $\Q$-vector space obtained from $M$ by restriction of scalars along the  
evident inclusion $\Q ⊆ \Q[x]$ and let $t : V → V$ be the $\Q$-linear transformation given  
as multiplication by $x$. Find, with justification, the rational canonical form of $t$.
(b) Consider the $\C[x]$-module $$N=\frac{\C[x]}{(x^4-1)}\oplus\frac{\Q[x]}{x^2(x-1)}$$and let $W$ the $\C$-vector space obtained from $N$ by restriction of scalars along $\C ⊆ \C[x]$  
and let $t : W → W$ be the $\C$-linear transformation given as multiplication by $x$. Find,  
with justification, the Jordan canonical form of $t$.
