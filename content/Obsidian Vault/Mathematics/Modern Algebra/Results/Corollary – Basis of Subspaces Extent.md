#### $\cor$ – Basis of Subspaces Extent
Suppose $F$ is a [[Field|field]] an $W$ is a subspace (i.e., [[Submodule|submodule]]) of the $F$-[[Vector Space|vector space]] (i.e., $F$-module) $V$. Then every [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] of $W$ extends to a basis of $V$ – that is, if $B$ is a basis of $W$ then there exists a basis $\tilde{B}$ of $V$ such that $B$ is a subset of $\tilde{B}$.

###### *Proof.* 
Just apply the Theorem with $B = I$ and $S = V$. (Since $B$ is a basis of $W$, it is linearly independent, and observe that $B$ remains linearly independent when regarded as a subset of $V$.)
