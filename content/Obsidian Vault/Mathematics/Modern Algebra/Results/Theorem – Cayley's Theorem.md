#### $\thm$ – Cayley's Theorem
Every [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $S_n$.

###### *Proof.* 
Suppose $G$ is a finite group and label the group elements of $G$ from $1$ to $n$ anyway you like. Then the left regular [[Group Action|action]] of $G$ on itself determines a [[Proposition – Permutation Representation|permutation representation]] $\rho:G\to \Perm(G)$ which gives a bijective group [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $\rho: G \to \im(\rho)$. Hence $G\cong \im(\rho)$[^1] and $\im(\rho)$ is a subgroup of $S_n$.
