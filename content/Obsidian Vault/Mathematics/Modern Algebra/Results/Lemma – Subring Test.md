#### $\lem$ â€“ Subring Test
A nonempty subset $S$ of a [[Ring|ring]] $R$ is a [[Subring|subring]] iff either one of the following hold:
1. $S$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $R$ closed under multiplication.[^1]
2. $S$ is closed under subtraction and multiplication.

###### *Proof.* 
***

[^1]: This is different than being a [[Multiplicatively Closed Set]]. Here we mean that $xy\in S$ for all $x,y\in S$.
