#### $\cor$ â€“ F.G. Modules Finitely Presented when Noetherian
Any [[Generator|finitely generated]] [[Module|module]] $M$ over a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]] [[Ring|ring]] $R$ has a finite [[Presentation of $R$-Module|presentation]]; that is, given such a module over such a ring, there exists an  $m \times n$ matrix $A$ in $R$ and an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] $$M\cong R^m/\im(T_A).$$

###### *Proof.* 
We basically already proved this, but let me recap it:

If $M$ is finitely generated, then for some $m$ we can find a surjective $R$-module homomorphism
$$
\pi: R^m \onto M.
$$
Since we assume $R$ is Noetherian, the kernel of $\pi$ is also finitely generated by the Proposition, and so we may find a surjection of $R$-modules
$$
g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi)
$$
for some $n$. The composition $R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m$ is equal to $T_A$ for some $n \times m$  matrix $A$. Since $\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)$, the first isomorphism theorem gives an isomorphism
$$
R^m/\im(T_A) = R^m/\ker(\pi) \cong M.
$$
