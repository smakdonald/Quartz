#### $\lem$ â€“ $x^m = e \to |x| \big| m$.
If $x^m = e$ then $|x| \mid m$.[^1]

###### *Proof.* 
Let $n = |x|$. We have $m = nq + r$ for some $0 \leq r < n$ by the division algorithm. #later
We have $x^r = (x^n)^qx^r = x^m = e$ and so, by the definition of order, it must be that $r = 0$

[^1]: In words, the order $n$ of an element $x$ is the smallest natural number such that $x^n=e$. We refer to this as the minimality of $n$.
