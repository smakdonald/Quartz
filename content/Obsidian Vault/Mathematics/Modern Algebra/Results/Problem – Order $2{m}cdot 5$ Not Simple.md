### Problem 1 â€“ Order $2^{m}\cdot 5$ Not Simple
Prove that no [[Group|group]] of [[Order|order]] $2^m \cdot 5$ with $m\geq 1$ is [[Simple Group|simple]].

##### *Proof.*
Let $G$ be a group of order $2^m \cdot 5$ with $m \leq 1$, and suppose by way of contradiction that $G$ is simple. 
By Sylow's Theorem we know the following:
- $n_{5}|2^m$ and $n_5\equiv1\mod{5}$, and 
- $n_{2}|5$ and $n_{2}\equiv1\mod{2}$, so our options are $3$ and $5$. 
Suppose its $3$. Let $G$ act on $\Syl_2(P)$ by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism $\rho:G\to S_{3}$. The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of Sylow's Theorem. Notice $|G|$ does not divide the order of $S_{3}$, so our kernel cannot be all of $G$, making $\ker(\rho)$ a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$. 

If $n_2=5$, then $G$ must divide $5!$, meaning that $m=1$. However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order $5$ has index $2$ in $G$, making it normal.

Thus $G$ cannot be simple.
