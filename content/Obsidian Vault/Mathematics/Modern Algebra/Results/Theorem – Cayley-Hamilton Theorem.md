#### Theorem â€“ Cayley-Hamilton $\thm$
Let $F$ be a [[Field|field]], $V$ a [[Dim (Vector Space)|finite dimensional]] $F$-[[Vector Space|vector space]], and $g: V \to V$ an $F$-[[Linear Operator|linear operator]]. Let $f_1(x), \dots, f_s(x)$ be the [[Invariant Factor|invariant factors]] of $g$. 
1. The product of the invariant factors of $g$ equals the [[Characteristic Polynomial|characteristic polynomial]] of $g$: $$\cp_g(x) = f_1(x) \cdots f_s(x).$$
2. The largest invariant factor of $g$  is equal to the [[Minimum Polynomial|minimum polynomial]] of $g$: $$\mp_g(x) = f_s(x).$$
3. (The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem) The minimum polynomial of $g$ divides its characteristic polynomial. In particular, $g$ satisfies its characteristic polynomial: $$\cp_g(g) = 0.$$
###### *Proof.* 
The first assertion is a consequence of Corollary \ref{cor330}, since the product of the diagonal elements of the Smith Normal Form of $xI_n - A$ is equal to the determinant  of $xI_n - A$.  (Technically, we can only conclude at first that they are only associates, but since each is monic, they must be equal.) 

For the second, we use the isomorphism of $F[x]$-modules
$$
V_g \cong F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x)). 
$$
Note that a polynomial $p(x)$ annihilates $F[x]/(f_i(x))$ if and only if $f_i(x)$ divides $p(x)$.
Since  $f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_s$, the annihilator of the $F[x]$-module $F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x))$ is generated by $f_s(x)$. Thus the annihilator of $V_t$ is also generated by $f_s(x)$, and by the Proposition \ref{prop330} $f_s(x)$ is the minimum polynomial of $t$. 

The third assertion is an immediate consequence of the first two.
