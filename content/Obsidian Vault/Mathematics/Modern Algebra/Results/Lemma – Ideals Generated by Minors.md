#### $\lem$ â€“ Ideals Generated by Minors
For any [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] $R$ and matrix $A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)$, if $B$ is obtained from $A$ via an elementary [[Elementary Row & Column Operations|row]] or column operation, then the [[Ideal|ideal]] of $R$ [[Generator|generated]] by all the $k \times k$ [[Minor|minors]] of $B$ equals the ideal of $R$ generated by all the $k \times k$ minors of $A$.
