#### $\prop$ â€“ Intermediate Extensions are Galois
If $F \subseteq L$ is a ([[Degree of Field Extension|finite]]) [[Galois Extension|Galois]] [[Field Extension|extension]], then so is $E \subseteq L$ for any [[Intermediate Field|intermediate]] [[Field|field]] $E$.

##### *Proof.*
This is immediate from the definition: If $L$ is the splitting field over $F$ of a separable polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$, then $L$ is also the splitting field over $E$ of the same polynomial, now regarded as belonging to $E[x]$.
