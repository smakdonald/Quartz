### Problem 3 â€“ Order $2^{m}\cdot 7$ Not Simple
Prove that no [[Group|group]] of [[Order|order]] $2^m \cdot 7$ with $m \geq 1$ is [[Simple Group|simple]].

##### *Proof.*
Let $G$ be a group of order $2m\cdot 7$ with $m\geq1$ and suppose by way of contradiction that $G$ is simple. 

By Sylow's Theorem we know the following:
- $n_{7}|2^m$ and $n_7\equiv1\mod{7}$, and 
- $n_{2}|7$ and $n_{2}\equiv1\mod{2}$, so our options are $3,5,7$. 

Let $G$ act on $\Syl_2(P)$ by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism $\rho:G\to S_{n_2}$. The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of Sylow's Theorem. Notice that if $n_2$ is $3$ or $5$ then $|G|$ does not divide the order of $S_{n_2}$, so our kernel cannot be all of $G$, making $\ker(\rho)$ a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$. 

If $n_2=7$, then $G$ must divide $7!$, meaning that $m=1$. However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order $7$ has index $2$ in $G$, making it normal.

Thus $G$ cannot be simple.
