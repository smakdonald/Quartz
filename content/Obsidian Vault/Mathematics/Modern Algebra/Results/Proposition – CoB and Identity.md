#### $\prop$ â€“ CoB and Identity
Let $V, W$  be finitely [[Generator|generated]] [[Basis and Free Module|free]] [[Module|modules]] over a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] $R$, let $B$ and $B'$ be [[Basis and Free Module|bases]] of $V$, let $C$ and $C'$ be bases of $W$, and let $f: V \to W$ be a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]]. Then[^1]
$$\begin{equation}[f]_{B'}^{C'} = [\id_W]_C^{C'} [f]_B^C [\id_V]_{B'}^{B}.\end{equation}$$

###### *Proof.* 
This is seen to hold by applying \eqref{E218} twice (since $\id_W \circ f \circ \id_V = f$).
