#### $\cor$ â€“ Automorphisms and Group Actions (Fields)
Let $K$ be the [[Splitting Field|spitting]] [[Field|field]] of some $f(x) \in F[x]$.
1. The [[Group|group]] $\Aut(K/F)$[^1] [[Group Action|acts]] on the set of roots $f(x)$ in $K$ by the rule $\s \cdot \a := \s(\a)$. 
2. This action is [[Faithful Action|faithful]]. 
3. If $f$ is [[Irreducible|irreducible]], this action is [[Transitive Action|transitive]].

##### *Proof.*
We proceed by induction on $[L:F]$. When $[L:F]=1$, we have $L = F$ and $\Aut(L/F)$ is the one element group.

For $[L: F] > 1$,  pick $\a \in L \setminus F$ and let $p(x) = m_{\a, F}(x)$. Consider the extension $F \subseteq F(\a)$.
Note that $H = \Aut(L/F(\a))$ is a subgroup of  $G = \Aut(L/F)$, by definition. By induction we have $|H| \leq [L: F(\a)]$.  Using the degree formula and the fact that $|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]$, it suffices to prove $[G:H] \leq [F(\a):F]$. This follows from:

{\em Claim:} Let $R$ be the set of roots of $p(x)$ that belong to $L$. Then the function
$$\begin{equation}
\theta: G/H  \to R
\end{equation}$$
given by $\theta(gH) = g(\a)$ is well-defined and injective. (Note: $H$ is not necessarily normal, and so $G/H$ isn't a group. By $G/H$ I just mean the {\em set} of left cosets of $H$ in $G$.)

\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim] 
By Proposition \ref{prop423},  for each $g \in G$  we have $g(\a) \in R$. Moreover, by definition of $H$, for all $h \in H$, we have $h(\a) = \a$ and hence $gh(\a)=g(h(\a))=g(\a)$. This proves $\theta$ is a well-defined function (i.e., it is independent of left coset representative). For $g_1, g_2 \in G$, if $g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)$ then $g_2^{-1}g_1(\a) = \a$ which implies $g_2^{-1}g_1 \in H$ (since if an automorphism of $L$ fixes $F$ and $\a$ then it fixes $F(\a)$). Thus $g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)$ implies $g_1H = g_2H$ and hence $\theta$ is one-to-one.
\end{proof}

Since $\deg(p(x)) = [F(\a): F]$, we conclude from the claim that $[G:H] =|G/H|\leq [F(\a): F]$. Putting all this together gives $|G| = |H|\cdot [G:H] \leq [L:F(\a)][F(\a):F] = [L:F]$.
