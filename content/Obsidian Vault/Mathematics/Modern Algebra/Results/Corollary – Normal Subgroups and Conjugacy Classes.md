#### $\cor$ â€“ Normal Subgroups and Conjugacy Classes
Let $N\norm G$ (See: [[Normal Subgroup|Normal]]). The conjugation [[Group Action|action]] of $G$ on itself induces an action by conjugation of $G$ on $N$. In particular, $N$ is the disjoint union of some of the [[Conjugacy Class|conjugacy classes]] in $G$.

###### *Proof.* 
Define the conjugation action of $G$ on $N$ by $g\cdot n=gng^{-1}$ for all $g\in G$ and $n\in N$. Since $N\norm G$ this is well defined. The two properties in the definition of the action hold for the action of $G$ by conjugation on $N$ since they hold more generally for the action of $G$ by conjugation on $G$. Therefore this is indeed an action. The orbits of elements $n\in N$ under this action are $[n]_c$. Thus the conjugacy classes of the elements of $N$ partition $N$.
