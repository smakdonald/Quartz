#### $\cor$ â€“ FTFGMOPRIFF
Let $k$ be a [[Field|field]] and $k[x]$ be the [[Polynomial Ring|ring of polynomials]] with coefficients in $k$ in one variable $x$. If  $M$ a [[Generator|finitely generated]] $k[x]$-[[Module|module]] then $$M \cong k[x]^r \oplus k[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus k[x]/(f_s(x))$$for some $r \geq 0$, $s \geq 0$ and non-constant monic polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_s$ such that $f_1 \mid f_2 \mid \cdots \mid f_s.$ Moreover, $r$, $s$ and $f_1, \dots, f_s$ are unique.

###### *Proof.* 
This follows from the Theorem since $k[x]$ is a Euclidean domain and every non-zero polynomial is associate to a unique monic one.
