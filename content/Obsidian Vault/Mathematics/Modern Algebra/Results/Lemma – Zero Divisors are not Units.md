#### $\lem$ â€“ Zero Divisors are not Units
If $a$ is a [[Zero-Divisor|zero divisor]] in a [[Ring|ring]] $R$, then $a$ is not a [[Unit|unit]].

###### *Proof.* 
Suppose that $a$ is both a zero divisor and a unit. Then there exists $b\neq 0$ such that $ab=0$ or $ba=0$. Multiplying either of these equations by $a^{-1}$ gives $b=0$, a contradiction.
