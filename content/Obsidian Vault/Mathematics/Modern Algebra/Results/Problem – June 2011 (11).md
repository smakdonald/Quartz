### Problem 6 – June 2011 (11)
Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] with $1\neq 0$ and let $f : R^m\to R^n$ be a surjective $R$-[[Module|module]] [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]], with $m$ and $n$ integers. Prove $m ≥ n$.

##### *Proof*.
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1\neq 0$, and let $f : R^m\to R^n$ be a surjective homomorphism of free $R$-modules. Prove that $m \leq n$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $R^n=N$ and $R^m=M$.

Let $I$ be a maximal ideal in $R$. Thus $R/I$ is a field. Lemma tells us that $M/IM$ and $N/IN$ are $R/I$-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to $\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN$, which is a surjective $R/I$-module linear transformation. 

Note that $M$ is generated by $e_i+IM$ for $i\leq m$. Let $a_i\in R$ and consider $\sum a_ie_i=0$. For this to be $0$ we need it to be in $IM$, and thus all $a_i\in I$. So the set of $e_i$ is a basis for $M/IM$ with $m$ elements. Likewise $N/IN$ has a basis with $n$ elements. As we are surjective, Rank$=n$, $\dim=m$. So by Rank-Nullity $\dim(\ker)=m-n$ which is only positive with $m\geq n$.
