#### $\cor$ â€“ Every Vector Space has a Basis
Every $F$-[[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$ has a [[Basis and Free Module|basis]]. Moreover, every [[Linearly Independent|linearly independent]] subset of $V$ is contained in some basis, and every set of vectors that [[Generator|spans]] $V$ contains some basis. 
  
###### *Proof.* 
For this first part, apply the theorem with $I = \emptyset$ and $S = V$. For the second and third, use $I$ arbitrary and $S = V$ and $I = \emptyset$ and $S$ arbitrary, respectively.
