#### $\lem$ â€“ Formula for Generated Ideal
For a subset $A$ of a [[Ring|ring]] $R$ with $1$[^1],  the [[Ideal|ideal]] [[Generator|generated]] by $A$ is given by $$(A)=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i a_i y_i \mid a_i \in A, x_i, y_i \in R\right\}.$$ If $R$ is [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] and $A$ is any subset, then there is a simpler formula
$$(A)=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i a_i \mid n \geq 0, r_i \in R, a_i \in A\right\}.$$
