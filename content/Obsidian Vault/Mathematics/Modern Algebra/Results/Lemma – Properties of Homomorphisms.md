#### $\lem$ â€“ Properties of Homomorphisms
If $f: G \to H$ is a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] of [[Group|groups]], then
1. $f(e_G) = e_H$ and 
2. $f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}$. 

###### *Proof.* 
For the first,[^1] $$f(e_G) = f(e_Ge_G) = f(e_G)f(e_G)$$ and now multiply by $f(e_G)^{-1}$. For the second, $f(x^{-1}) f(x) = f(e) = e$ implies $f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}$.

[^1]: Here we are using the fact that homomorphisms are operation preserving.
