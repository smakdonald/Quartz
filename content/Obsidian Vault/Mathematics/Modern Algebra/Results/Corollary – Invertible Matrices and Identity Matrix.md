#### $\cor$ â€“ Invertible Matrices and Identity Matrix
If $A$ is invertible then it can be transformed into $I_n$ via elementary [[Elementary Row & Column Operations|row]] and column operations of type I and II.

###### *Proof.* 
Apply the Theorem and then use a single type II operator; i.e., multiply the first row by $u^{-1}$.
