#### $\lem$ â€“ GCD and Field Extensions
Let $F$ be a [[Field|field]]. For $f, g \in F[x]$[^1], not both of which are $0$, recall that $\gcd_{F[x]}(f,g)$ denotes the unique monic [[Generator|generator]] of the [[Ideal|ideal]] in $F[x]$ generated by $f$ and $g$.
1. For any field [[Field Extension|extension]] $F \subseteq L$, $\gcd_{F[x]}(f,g) = \gcd_{L[x]}(f,g)$.
2. Let $\overline{F}$ be an [[Algebraic Closure|algebraic closure]] of $F$. $\gcd_{F[x]}(f,g) = 1$ if any only if $f$ and $g$ have no common roots in $\overline{F}$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $h = \gcd_{F[x]}(f, g)$. To prove (1), we note that $h$ is the unique monic polynomial such that
- $h = f \cdot p + g \cdot q$ for some $p,q \in F[x]$,
- $f = h \cdot \a$ for soem $\a \in F[x]$, and
- $g = h \cdot \beta$ for soem $\beta \in F[x]$.
Since $F[x]$ is a subring of $L[x]$, these three properties also hold when we regard $h,f,g$ as belonging to $L[x]$ and thus by the uniqueness property, we have $h = \gcd_{L[x]}(f,g)$.

(2) is a consequence of (1), since if two polynomials factor completely into linear factors, then they are relatively prime if and only if they have no linear factors in common, which is equivalent to their having no roots in common.
