### Problem 1 â€“ Smallest Prime Divisor
Let $G$ be a [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] and let $H$ be a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$ of [[Index|index]] $p$, where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of the [[Order|order]] of $G$. Prove that $H$ is [[Normal Subgroup|normal]] in $G$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $S=G/H$ and note that $|S|=p$. Let $K$ denote the kernel of the permutation representation generated by $G$ acting on $S$ by left multiplication.

The First Isomorphism Theorem tells us that $G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq S_p$. Thus $|K|\big|p!$ by Lagrange's Theorem. Let $k\in K$. Then $kgH=gH$ for all $g\in G$, making $k\in gHg\inv$ for all $g\in G,$ including $e$. Thus $K\nsg H$. 

This yields $[G:K]=[G:H][H:K]$. Let $h=[H:K]$, giving us $[G:K]=ph$. As $|K|\big|p!$ we have $h|(p-1)!$, so $h<p$. But $p$ is the smallest prime dividing the order of $G$, and thus $h=1$, making $H=K$ and $H\nsg G$.
