### Problem 1 – Prime Index and HK
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]], and $H, K \leq G$ be [[Subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$.

(a) Give an example of $G, H,$ and $K$ such that $HK$ (See: [[HK]]) is not a subgroup of $G$.
(b) Suppose now that $H\nsg G$ (See: [[Normal Subgroup|Normal]]) and $[G : H] = p$ (See: [[Index]]),  where $p$ is prime. Prove that either $K \leq H$ or  $G = KH$.

##### *Proof.*

###### Part (a)
Let $G=S_3$[^1], $H=\langle(12)\rangle$, and $K=\langle(13)\rangle$. Notice that $H\cap K=\{e\}$, and thus $|HK|=4$[^2], which does not divide $6$[^3]. Thus $HK$ is not a subgroup of $G$. 

[^1]: There aren't many specific groups we work with, so when it comes to specific examples, [[Permutation Group|permutation groups]] are usually a good place to start!
[^2]: $|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K}$, (See: [[Corollary – Order of $HK$|Result]])
[^3]: The order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. See: [[Theorem – Lagrange's Theorem|Lagrange's Theorem]]

###### Part (b)
Suppose there exists some $k\in K$ such that $k\not\in H$. We examine $kH\in G/H$. Notice that since $G/H$ has prime order it is cyclic, and thus generated by any non-identity element, such as $kH$. Thus any element in $G/H$ can be written in the form $k^iH$, and any element in $G$ can subsequently be written as $k^ih$ for some $h\in H$. Thus $G=KH$.
