#### $\prop$ â€“ Finite Extensions are Algebraic
If $F \subseteq L$ is a [[Degree of Field Extension|finite]] [[Field Extension|extension]] of [[Field|fields]], then it is [[Algebraic Extension|algebraic]]. 

##### *Proof.*
Pick $\a \in L$. Since $F(\a)$ is a $F$-vector subspace of $ L$ and $\dim_F(L) = [L: F] < \infty$ we have $[F(\a): F] < \infty$. (One could also appeal to the Degree Formula for this.) So by (4) of Theorem \ref{thm39b}, $\a$ is algebraic of $F$.
