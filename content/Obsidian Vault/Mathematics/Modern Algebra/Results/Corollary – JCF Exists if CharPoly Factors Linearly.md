#### $\cor$ – JCF Exists if CharPoly Factors Linearly
If $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix with entries in a [[Field|field]] $F$ and $\cp_A(x)$ (See: [[Characteristic Polynomial|CharPoly]]) factors completely into linear factors, then $A$ is [[Similar Matrices|similar]] to a matrix in [[Theorem – Jordan Canonical Form|Jordan Canonical Form]], and this matrix is unique up to the ordering of the [[Jordan Block|Jordan blocks]].
