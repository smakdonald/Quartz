### Problem 1 â€“ Every Subgroup Normal 
Let $G$ be a [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]].
(a) Suppose every [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$ is [[Normal Subgroup|normal]]. Prove that given any positive divisor $d$ of $|G|$ there exists a subgroup of $G$ of order $d$.
(b) Give an example, with justification, of a finite group $G$ and a positive divisor $d$ of $|G|$ such that $G$ has no subgroup of order $d$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $G$ be a finite group.

###### Part (a)
Suppose every subgroup of $G$ is normal. Let $d$ be a positive divisor of $|G|$. For every prime $p$ dividing the order of $G$ there is exactly one Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, given that Sylow $p$-subgroups are normal if and only if they are unique. Thus $G$ can be written as a direct product of its Sylow $p$-subgroups. Given the prime factorization of $d$, the direct product of the Sylow $p$-subgroups such that $p|d$ is 
1. A subgroup of $G$ as each Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal, and
2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order $d$. 
The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of $G$ of order $d$.

###### Part (b)
We take a peak at $G=A_4$ with $d=6$. Suppose $A_4$ had a subgroup of order $6$, $H$. First, note that $[G:H]=2$, the smallest prime dividing the order of $G$, making $H$ normal in $G$.

As there are eight $3$-cycles in $G$, there exists some $3$-cycle, $\sigma$, such that $\s\not\in H$. Consider then $H, \s H,$ and $\s^2 H$ in $G/H$. Since $|G/H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=2$, it must be the case that either $\s^2H=\s H$ or $\s^2H=H$. 

- If $\s^2 H=H$ then $\s^2\in H$. As $|\s|=3$ we have $\s^2=\s\inv$, but as $H$ is a subgroup this would mean $(\s\inv)\inv=\s\in H$, which is not the case.
- If $\s^2 H=\s H$ then $\s\inv\s^2\in H$, but $\s\inv\s^2=\s$, and so we have a contradiction.
Thus $H$ cannot exist, and $G$ has no subgroup of order $6$.
