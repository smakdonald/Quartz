#### $\cor$ â€“ Degree 4 Polynomials Solvable by Radicals
Every polynomial of [[Polynomial Degree|degree]] at most $4$ in $\Q[x]$ is a [[Solvable by Radicals|solvable by radicals]].

##### *Proof.*
By Proposition \ref{prop423}, if $K$ is the splitting field of  a polynomial $f \in \Q[x]$ of degree $n \geq 1$, then $\Aut(K/\Q)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$. The result thus follows from the Theorem and the facts that $S_n$ is solvable for all $n \leq 4$ and subgroups of solvable groups are again solvable.
