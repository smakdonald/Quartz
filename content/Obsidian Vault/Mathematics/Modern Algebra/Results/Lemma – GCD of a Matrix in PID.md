#### $\lem$ â€“ GCD of a Matrix in PID
Suppose $R$ is a [[Principal Ideal Domain|PID]] and $A$ is a matrix with entries in $R$ and $B$ is a matrix obtained from $A$ via elementary [[Elementary Row & Column Operations|row]] and column operations. Then $\gcd(A) = \gcd(B)$ where the gcd of a matrix is defined to be the gcd of all of its entries.
