#### $\prop$ â€“ $I+J, I\cap J, IJ, \bigcap_{\a\in J} I_\a$ all Ideals
Let $R$ be a [[Ring|ring]] and let $I,J$ be [[Ideal|ideals]] of $R$. Then
1. $I + J := \{a + b \mid a \in I, b \in J\}$ is an ideal
2. $I\cap J$ is  an ideal
3. $IJ=\{\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_j \mid n\geq 0, a_i\in I, b_j\in J\}$ is an ideal and $IJ\subseteq I\cap J$.
4. The intersection $\bigcap_{\a\in J} I_\a$ of any collection of ideals $I_\a$ of $R$ is an ideal.
The set of all ideals of a ring $R$ is a [[Poset and Lattice|lattice]] with respect to the partial order given by containment. In this lattice, the supremum of a pair of ideals $I,J$ is $I+J$ and the infimum is $I\cap J$.
