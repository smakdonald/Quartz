Fundamental Theorem of finitely generated modules over a PID, invariant factors form
Let $R$ be a [[Principal Ideal Domain|PID]] and let $M$ be a finitely [[Generator|generated]] module. Then there exist integers $r \geq 0, k \geq 0$, and non-zero, non-[[Unit|unit]] elements $d_1,\ldots, d_k$ of $R$ satisfying $d_1 \mid  d_2 \mid \dots \mid d_k$[^1] such that $$M \cong R^r \oplus R/(d_1) \oplus \dots \oplus R/(d_k).$$ Moreover $r$ and $k$ are uniquely determined by $M$, and the $d_i$'s are unique up to [[Associates|associates]].
