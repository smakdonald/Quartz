#### $\cor$ â€“ Matrices Equivalent iff Path with Operations
Given two $m \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ with entries in a [[Field|field]], $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if and only if each can be transformed to the other via elementary [[Elementary Row & Column Operations|row]] and column operations.
