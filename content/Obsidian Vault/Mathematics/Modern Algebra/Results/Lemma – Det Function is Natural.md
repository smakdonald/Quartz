#### $\lem$ â€“ Det Function is Natural
The [[Determinant Function|determinant function]] $\det$ is "natural'': If $g: R \to S$ is a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] of non-zero [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|rings]] and $A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(R)$, then $$g \det(A) = \det(g(A))$$ where $g(A)$ denotes the matrix obtained by applying $g$ to the entries of $A$.

###### *Proof.* 
This follows from the formula for $\det$, since $g$ commutes with sums and products.
