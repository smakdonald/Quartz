#### $\lem$ â€“ Unique Subgroups of Order are Normal
Suppose $G$ is a [[Group|group]] and $n$ is a positive integer. Then
1. If $H\leq G$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of [[Order|order]] $n$, then $gHg^{-1}\leq G$ is a subgroup of order $n$.
2. If there is a unique subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $n$, then $H \nsg G$[^1].
