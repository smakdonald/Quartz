#### $\thm$ â€“ $A_5$ Simple
$A_5$[^1] is a [[Simple Group|simple]] [[Group|group]].

###### *Proof.* 
Suppose $N \nsg A_5$. Then $\#N \mid 60$ and
$$
\#N = 1 + \text{ the sum of a sub-list of the list $20, 12, 12, 15$}.
$$
By checking the relatively small number of cases we see that $\# N = 1$ or $\#N = 60$ are the only possibilities.
