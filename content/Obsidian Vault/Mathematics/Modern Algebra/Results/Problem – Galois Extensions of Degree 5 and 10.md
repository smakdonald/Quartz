### Problem 9 â€“ Galois Extensions of Degree 5 and 10
Let $K$ be a [[Galois Extension|Galois extension]] of $F$ with $|\Gal(K/F)| = 20$[^1].
(a) Prove that there exists a [[Subring|subfield]] $E$ of $K$ containing F with $[E : F ] = 5$[^2].
(b) Determine whether there must also exist a subfield $L$ of $K$ containing $F$ with $[L : F ] = 10$.

##### *Proof.*
Let $K$ be a Galois extension of $F$ with $|\Gal(K/F )| = 20$.

###### Part (a) 
Let $P$ be a Sylow $2$-subgroup of $\Gal(K/F)$. Notice that $|P|=4$. By the FTGT there exists an intermediate field extension $E$ such that $|\Gal(K/E)|=4$. By the Degree Formula, we have $[K:F]=[K:E][E:F]$, with $[K:F]=20$ and $[K:L]=4$. Thus $[L:F]=5$.

###### Part (b) 
Notice that as $2$ is a prime dividing the order of $\Gal(K/F )$ there must exist an element of order $2$ by Cauchy's Theorem. The cyclic subgroup, $H$, generated by this element has order $2$. By the FTGT there exists an intermediate field extension $L$ such that $|\Gal(K/L)|=2$. By the Degree Formula, we have $[K:F]=[K:L][L:F]$, with $[K:F]=20$ and $[K:L]=2$. Thus $[L:F]=2$.
