### Problem 3 â€“ Group of Order 18515 Abelian
Suppose $G$ is a group of order $5 \cdot 7 \cdot 23^2$ and that $G$ contains an element of order $35$. Prove G is abelian.

##### *Proof.*
By Sylow's Theorem we know the number of Sylow $23$-subgroups of $G$ must divide $35$ and be congruent to $1\mod{23}$, the only option of which is $1$. Let $H$ denote the unique Sylow $23$-subgroup and let $K$ be the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order $35$. 

As $H$ is unique it is normal in $G$, and it also means we have $HK\leq G$. Notice that as $H$ and $K$ are groups of relatively prime order we have $H\cap K=\{e\}$. Thus $|HK|=|G|$, and so $G=HK$, making $G\cong H\times K$, a direct product of abelian groups. Thus $G$ is abelian.
