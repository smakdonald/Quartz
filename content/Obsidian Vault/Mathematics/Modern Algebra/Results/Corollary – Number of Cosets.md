#### $\cor$ â€“ Number of Cosets
If $G$ is a [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] and $H \leq G$, then
$$\begin{aligned}
|G| & = |H| \cdot (\text{the number of left cosets of H in G}) \\
& = |H| \cdot (\text{the number of right cosets of H in G}). \\
\end{aligned}$$
In particular the number of left [[Coset|cosets]] of $H$ in $G$ is equal to the number of right cosets of $H$ in $G.$
