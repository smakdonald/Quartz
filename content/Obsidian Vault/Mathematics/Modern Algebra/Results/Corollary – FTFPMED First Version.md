#### $\cor$ â€“ FTFPMED: First Version
If $R$ is a [[Euclidean Domain|Euclidean domain]] and $M$ is a finitely [[Presentation of $R$-Module|presented]] $R$-[[Module|module]], then $M$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[Direct Product, Sum|direct sum]] of [[Cyclic|cyclic]] modules: $$M \cong R/d_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/d_l \oplus R^a$$for some $a \geq 0$ and some non-zero, non-invertible elements $d_1, \dots, d_l \in R$ such that $d_1 \mid d_2 \mid \cdots \mid d_l$.

###### *Proof.* 
This  is an immediate consequence of the SNF Theorem, Theorem \ref{thm39} parts (1) and (2), and Lemma \ref{lem31}.
