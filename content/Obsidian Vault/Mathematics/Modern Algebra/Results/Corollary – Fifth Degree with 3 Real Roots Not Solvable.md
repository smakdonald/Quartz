#### $\cor$ â€“ Fifth Degree with 3 Real Roots Not Solvable
Let $f(x) \in \Q[x]$ be any fifth degree, [[Irreducible|irreducible]] polynomial having exactly three real roots. Then $f(x)$ is not [[Solvable by Radicals|solvable by radicals]] over $\Q$.

##### *Proof.* 
Let $K$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\Q$. As sketched out in Example \ref{ex55}, $\Gal(K/\Q) \cong S_5$ and hence it is not solvable.
