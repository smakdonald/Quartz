#### $\cor$ â€“ Center of $p$-group is Nontrivial 
If $p$ is a prime number and $G$ is a [[Order|finite]] [[Group|group]] of [[Order|order]] $p^m$ for some $m > 0$, then $Z(G)$[^1] is not the trivial group (In fact $|Z(G)|=p^a$ for some $a>0$). 

###### *Proof.* 
Let $g_1,\ldots g_r \in G$ be a list of unique representatives of all of the conjugacy classes of $G$ of size greater than 1 as in the class equation. Then for each $i$, $C_G(g_i)\neq G$ so $[G:C_G(g_i)]\neq 1$. Since $1\neq [G:C_G(g_i)] \mid |G|=p^m$, it follows that $p\mid [G:C_G(g_i)]$ for each $i$. From the Class equation we deduce that $p\mid |Z(G)|$ so, $|Z(G)|\neq 1$.
