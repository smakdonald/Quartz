### Problem 9 â€“ Quintic with Two Complex Roots
Consider $f (x) = x^5 -20x - 2 \in \Q[x].$ This polynomial has exactly three real roots, a fact that you may use without proof.

(a) Show that $f$ is [[Irreducible|irreducible]] in $\Q[x]$.
(b) Let $L$ be a [[Splitting Field|splitting field]] of $f$ $over $\Q$. Show that $L/\Q$ is a [[Galois Extension|Galois extension]] and find the [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] class of the [[Galois Extension|Galois group]] $\Gal(L/\Q)$.

##### *Proof.*

###### Part (a)
Notice that $p=2$ is prime in $\Q[x]$, and thus $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ by Eisenstein's Criterion.

###### Part (b)
Let $\alpha$ be a real root of $f(x)$. As $f$ is irreducible this root is not in $\Q$. As $\alpha$ is the root of a monic irreducible polynomial of degree $5$, we see that $[\Q(\alpha):\Q]=5$. By the FTGT there exists a subgroup of $\Gal(L/\Q)$ with order $5$, making it a cyclic subgroup generated by some element of order $5$. 

However, as $f$ only has $2$ complex roots we see that complex conjugation corresponds to an element of order $2$ in $\Gal(L/\Q)\cong H\leq S_5$. Thus we have a transposition and a $5$-cycle, meaning we can generate all of $S_5$. $\Gal(L/\Q)\cong S_5$.
