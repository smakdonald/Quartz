#### $\prop$ â€“ Disjoint Cycles & Transpositions
1. Each $\sigma \in S_n$[^1] can be written as a product (composition) of disjoint [[Cycle|cycles]], and such a factorization is unique up to the ordering of the factors. 
2. Each $\sigma \in S_n$ can be written a product of transpositions; i.e., $S_n$ is [[Generator|generated]] by transpositions. 

###### *Proof.* 
We will prove part (1) in due time.

Granted (1), we prove (2).

From (1), it suffices to prove this for a single cycle because we first decompose the [[Permutation Group|permutation]] as a product of cycles and then we decompose each cycle as a product of transpositions. For a cycle $(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots \, i_p)$ the identity 
$$
(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots \, i_p) =  (i_1 \, i_2) (i_2 \, i_3) \cdots   (i_{p-2} \, i_{p-1}) (i_{p-1} \, i_p)
$$
is seen to hold by direct calculation.
