#### $\prop$ â€“ Application of Isomorphism Invariant
If $P$ is an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] [[Isomorphism Invariant|invariant]], $G$ is a [[Group|group]] that has $P$, and $H$ is a group that does not have $P,$ then $G$ is not isomorphic to $H$.

###### *Proof.* 
This statement is the contrapositive of Isomorphism Invariant Definition.
