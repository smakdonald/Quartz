### Problem 8 – Quartic and Unique Galois Extension
Let $L$ be the [[Splitting Field|splitting]] [[Field|field]] of $x^4-2022$ over $\Q$. Prove there exists a unique [[Intermediate Field|intermediate]] field $\Q\subseteq K\subseteq L$ such that $[K : \Q] = 4$[^1] and $\Q\subseteq K$ is a [[Galois Extension|Galois]] extension.

###### *Proof*.
Let $L$ be the splitting field of $f(x)=x^4-2022$ over $\Q$. Let $\z$ be a primitive fourth root of unity. Thus $\z=e^{2\pi i/4}=e^{\pi/2}=\cos(\pi/2)+i\sin(\pi/2)=i$.

Notice that the roots of $f$ are the following:
- $\sqrt[4]{2022} i$,
- $\sqrt[4]{2022}i^2=-\sqrt[4]{2022}$,
- $\sqrt[4]{2022}i^3=-\sqrt[4]{2022}i$, and
- $\sqrt[4]{2022}i^4=\sqrt[4]{2022}$.
Thus $L=\Q(\sqrt[4]{2022},i)$.

Using [[Theorem – Eisenstein's Criterion|Eisenstein's Criterion]] with $p=2$ we see that $f$ is [[Irreducible|irreducible]] in $\Q[x]$. Let $\a=\sqrt[4]{2022}$, and notice that $f$ is the [[Minimum Polynomial|minimum polynomial]] of $\a$. Let $K=\Q(\a)$ and observe $[K:\Q]=4$. 

As $i$ is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial $x^2+1$ we have $[L:F]=2$ and $[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8$. Thus $G=\Gal(L/\Q)$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $S_4$ of [[Order|order]] $8$, making it $D_8$. 

Notice that $K$ is an extension of degree $24$, and thus by the [[Theorem – Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory|FTGT]] we have a subgroup $H\leq G$ such that $H=\Gal(L/K)$. As $[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]$ we have $8=[L:K]\cdot 4$, and thus $|H|=2$. This makes $H$ the [[Cyclic|cyclic]] [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $D_8$ generated by a reflection, the only element of order $2$ in $D_8$, making it unique. This is also a [[Normal Subgroup|normal]] subgroup of $D_8$, making $K$ Galois over $\Q$.
