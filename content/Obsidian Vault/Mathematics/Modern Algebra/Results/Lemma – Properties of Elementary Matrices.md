#### $\lem$ â€“ Properties of Elementary Matrices
Let $E$ be an $n \times n$ [[Elementary Matrix|elementary matrix]]. 
- For a [[Basis and Free Module|free]] $R$-[[Module|module]] $V$ with [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] $B$ such that $|B| = n$, $E$ is the [[Change of Basis Matrix|change of basis matrix]] $[\id_V]_{B'}^{B}$, where $B'$ is the basis obtained from $B$ by the corresponding elementary basis change operation.
- If $A \in \Mat_{n,q}(R)$, then the product matrix $E \cdot A$ is the result of performing the corresponding elementary [[Elementary Row & Column Operations|row]] operation on $A$.
-  If $B \in \Mat_{m,n}(R)$, then the product matrix $B \cdot E$ is the result of performing the corresponding elementary column operation on $B$.
