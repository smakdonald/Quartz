With the invention of agriculture in the years 15,000- 10,000 B.C., humans had to address, in at least  
a rudimentary fashion, the two most fundamental concepts of mathematics: multiplicity and space 

We are accustomed to a base- l0 numeral system, derived from the 10 fingers of the human hand, so it may seem a bit odd that the Babylonians chose a base-60 system . While no one speculates that these ancient people had 60 fingers, their choice of base can still be seen in our measurement of time (60 seconds per minute) and angles (6 X 60 · = 360 · in a circle) .

##### Thales of Miletus

Thales of Miletus is generally credited with being the father  
of demonstrative mathematics, the first scholar who supplied the "why"  
along with the "how. " As such, he is the earliest known mathematician.

A noted mathematician and astronomer who somehow predicted the solar eclipse in 585 B.C., Thales, like the stereotypical scientist, was chronically absent-minded and incessantly preoccupied-according to legend, he once was strolling along, gazing upward at his beloved stars, when he tumbled into an open well .

His "fatherhood" of demonstrative mathematics notwithstanding, Thales never married. When Solon, a contemporary, asked why, Thales arranged a cruel ruse whereby a messenger brought Solon news of his son's death. According to Plutarch, Solon then  

>. . . began to beat his head and to do and say all that is usual with men in transports of grief. But Thales took his hand, and, with a smile, said, "These things, Solon, keep me from marriage and rearing children, which are too great for even your constancy to support; however, be not concerned at the report, for it is a fiction. "  

Thales was not the kindest of people. A similar impression emerges from the story of a farmer who routinely tied heavy bags of salt on the back of his donkey when driving the beast to market. The clever animal quickly learned to roll over while fording a particular stream, thereby dissolving much of the salt and making his burden far lighter. Exasperated, the farmer went to Thales for advice, and Thales recommended that on the next trip to market the farmer load the donkey with sponges.  

It was certainly not kindness to man or beast that earned Thales his high reputation in mathematics. Rather, it was his insistence that geometric statements not be accepted simply because of their intuitive plausibility; instead they had to be subjected to rigorous, logical proof. This is no small legacy to leave the discipline of mathematics.

##### Pythagorus 

Legend says that a grateful Pythagoras sacrificed an ox to the gods to celebrate the joy his proof brought to all concerned (except, presumably, the ox) .

Intuitively, the Pythagoreans felt that any two magnitudes are commensurable. Given two line segments, it seemed preposterous to doubt the existence of another segment EF dividing evenly into both, even if it took an extremely tiny EF to do the job. The presumed commensurability of segments was critical to the Pythagoreans, not only because they used this idea in their proofs about similar triangles but also because it seemed to support their philosophical stance on the central role of whole numbers.

Tradition credits the Pythagorean Hippasus with discovering that the side of a square and its diagonal are not commensurable. That is, no matter how small one goes, there is no magnitude EF dividing evenly into both the square's side and its diagonal. This discovery had a number of profound consequences. Obviously, it shattered those Pythagorean proofs that rested upon the supposed commensurability of all segments. Secondly, it had an unsettling impact upon the supremacy of whole numbers, for if not all quantities were commensurable, then whole numbers were somehow inadequate to represent the ratios of all geometric lengths. Consequently, the discovery firmly established the superiority of geometry over arithmetic in all subsequent Greek mathematics. Far better, thought the  
Greeks, to avoid the numerical approach altogether and concentrate on magnitudes simply as geometric entities. This preference for geometry over arithmetic would dominate a thousand years of Greek mathematics.

A final result of the discovery of irrationals was that the Pythagoreans, incensed at all the trouble Hippasus had caused, supposedly took him far out upon the Mediterranean and tossed him overboard to his death. If true, the story indicates the dangers inherent in free thinking, even in the relatively austere discipline of mathematics.

##### Hippocrates
Note in passing that Chios is not far from the island of Cos, where another " Hippocrates" was born about this time; it was Hippocrates of Cos-not our Hippocrates-who became the father of Greek medicine and originator of the physicians' Hippocratic oath.

Aristotle wrote that, while a talented geometer, he " . . . seems in other respects to have been stupid and lacking in sense." This is an early example of the stereotype of the mathematician as being somewhat overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life .

This enchantment with building the complex from the simple was also evident in the Greeks' geometric constructions . For them, the rules of the game required that all constructions be done only with compass and (unmarked) straightedge . These two fairly unsophisticated tools allowing the geometer to produce the most perfect, uniform one-dimensional figure (the straight line) and the most perfect, uniform two dimensional figure (the circle)-must have appealed to the Greek sensibilities for order, simplicity, and beauty.

The quadrature (or squaring) of a plane figure is the construction using only compass and straightedge-of a square having area equal to that of the original plane figure . If the quadrature of a plane figure can be accomplished, we say that the figure is quadrable (or squarable).

###### Quadrature of the rectangle
###### Quadrature of the triangle
###### Quadrature of the polygon
###### Great Theorem: The Quadrature of the Lune
- The Pythagorean theorem
- An angle inscribed in a semicircle is right.
- The areas of two circles or semicircles are to each other as the squares on their diameters.

The problem of squaring the circle remained unresolved from the time of Hippocrates until just over a century ago . At last, in 1882, the German mathematician Ferdinand Lindemann ( 1852-1939) succeeded in proving unequivocally that the quadrature of the circle was an impossibility.

###### The quadrature of the circle is impossible

And what did history have to say about lunes? Our great theorem above showed Hippocrates squaring a particular lune, and he managed to do two other kinds as well. Thus, as of 440 B.C., three types of lunes were known to be quadrable . At this point, progress stopped for over two millennia until, in 1771 , the great Leonhard Euler (1707- 1783) who will b e the object of our attention in Chapters 9 and 1 0-found two more kinds of lunes that were squarable. There the matter rested until the twentieth century when N. G. Tschebatorew and A. W. Dorodnow proved that these five are the only squarable lunes! All other lunes, such as the one that generated Alexander's harsh criticism cited earlier, share  
with the circle the impossibility of being squared.

##### Eudoxus of Cnidos

Eudoxus came to Athens about the time the Academy was being created and attended the lectures of Plato himself. Eudoxus' poverty forced him to live in Piraeus, on the outskirts of Athens, and make the daily round-trip journey to and from the Academy, thus distinguishing him as one of the first commuters (although we are unsure whether he had to pay out -of-city-state tuition).

It was Eudoxus who developed a valid theory of proportions and thereby supplied the long-sought proofs.
Eudoxus' other great contribution, the method of exhaustion, found immediate application in the determination of areas and volumes of the more sophisticated geometric figures. The general strategy was to approach an irregular figure by means of a succession of known elementary ones, each providing a better approximation than its predecessor. We can think, for instance, of a circle as being a totally curvilinear, and thus quite intractable, plane figure . But, if we inscribe within it a square, and then double the number of sides of the square to get an octagon, and then again double the number of sides to get a 16-gon, and so on, we will find these relatively simple polygons ever more closely approximating the circle itself. In Eudoxean terms, the polygons are "exhausting" the circle from within . The reader familiar with higher mathematics will recognize in the method of exhaustion the geometric forerunner of the modern notion of " limit," which in turn lies at the heart of the calculus

##### Euclid
Down through the centuries, over 2000 editions of the Elements have appeared, a figure that must make the authors of today's mathematics textbooks drool with envy.

Euclid did not just furnish proofs; he furnished them within this axiomatic framework. The advantages of such a development are significant. For one thing, it avoids circularity in reasoning. Each  
proposition has a clear, unambiguous string of predecessors leading back to the original axioms.
