#### $\thm$ â€“ Every Ideal Contained in a Maximal Ideal
Fix a ring $R$ and a proper ideal $I$. Let $S$ be the set of all proper ideals $J$ in $R$ such that $J \supseteq I$, which is partially ordered with the inclusion order $\subseteq$. We claim that \hyperref[Zorn's Lemma]{Zorn's Lemma} applies to $S$. First, $S$ is nonempty, since it contains $I$. Now consider a chain of proper ideals in $R$, say $\{ J_i \}_i$, all of which contain $I$. Notice that $J :=  \bigcup_i J_i$ is an ideal as well (exercise!), and moreover $J \neq R$ since $1 \notin J_i$ for all $i$.\footnote{Note that unions of ideals are not ideals in general, but a union of totally ordered ideals \emph{is} an ideal.} Since each $J_i \supseteq I$, we conclude that $J \supseteq I$. Thus we have checked that $J \in S$. Now this ideal $J \in S$ is an upper bound for our chain $\{ J_i \}_i$, and thus \hyperref[Zorn's Lemma]{Zorn's Lemma} applies to $S$. We conclude that $S$ has a maximal element.

There is a subtle point missing: we have shown that there is a maximal element $M$ in $S$ containing $I$, but we have yet to show that this maximal element is a maximal ideal of $R$. Finally, suppose that $L$ is an ideal in $R$ with $L \supseteq M$. Since $M$ contains $J$, so does $L$. If $L \in S$, by the maximality of $M$ we must have $L = M$. Since $L$ already satisfies $L \supseteq J$, if $L \notin S$ then we must have $L = R$.
