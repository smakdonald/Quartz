#### $\prop$ â€“ Noetherian F.G.
Let $R$ be a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian ring]]. Given an $R$-module $M$, $M$ is a [[Noetherian Module|noetherian]] $R$-module if and only if $M$ is finitely generated. Consequently, any submodule of a finitely generated $R$-module is also finitely generated.

##### *Proof.*
If $M$ is noetherian, $M$ is finitely generated by the equivalent definitions above, and so are all of its submodules.

Now let $R$ be noetherian and $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. Then $M$ is isomorphic to a quotient of $R^n$ for some $n$, which is noetherian by \Cref{M^n noetherian} and \Cref{quotient noetherian}.
