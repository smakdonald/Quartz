#### $\lem$ â€“ Homogeneous Equivalent Definition
Let $I$ be an ideal in a [[Graded Ring|graded]] ring $R$. The following are equivalent:
(a) $I$ is [[Homogeneous Ideal|homogeneous]].
(b) For any element $f\in R$ we have $f\in I$ if and only if every homogeneous component of $f$ lies in $I$. 
(c) $I = \bigoplus_{a \in T} I_a$, where $I_a = I \cap R_a$.

##### *Proof.*
(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): Let $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ be homogeneous generators for $I$. If $f\in I$, we can write $f$ as$$f = r_1 f_1 + \cdots + r_n f_n.$$We can also write each $r_i$ as a sum of its components, say $r_i = [r_i]_{d_{i,1}} + \cdots + [r_i]_{d_{i,m_i}} $. Then, after substituting and collecting, 
\[ f= \sum_{d} ( [r_1]_{d-|f_1|} f_1 + \cdots +   [r_n]_{d-|f_n|} f_n)\]
expresses $f$ as a sum of homogeneous elements of different degrees, so 
\[ f_d =  [r_1]_{d-|f_1|} f_1 + \cdots +   [r_n]_{d-|f_n|} f_n \in I.\]

(2) $\Rightarrow$ (1): Any element of $I$ is a sum of its homogeneous components. Thus, in this case, the set of homogeneous elements in $I$ is a generating set for $I$.

(2) $\Rightarrow$ (3): As above, $I$ is generated by the collection of additive subgroups $\{I_a\}$ in this case; the sum is direct as there is no nontrivial $\Z$-linear combination of elements of different degrees.

(3) $\Rightarrow$ (2): We can take generators for each abelian group $I \cap R_a$, and the collection of all of them is a generating set for $I$.
