#### $\lem$ â€“ Quotients of Graded Rings
Let $R$ be an $T$-[[Graded Ring|graded]] ring, and $I$ be a [[Homogeneous Ideal|homogeneous]] ideal. Then $R/I$ has a natural $T$-graded structure induced by the $T$-graded structure on $R$.

##### *Proof.*
The ideal $I$ decomposes as the direct sum of its graded components, so we can write
	$$R/I = \frac{\oplus R_a}{\oplus I_a} \cong \oplus \frac{R_a}{I_a}.$$
	It's elementary to check that this direct sum decomposition satisfies the desired properties.
