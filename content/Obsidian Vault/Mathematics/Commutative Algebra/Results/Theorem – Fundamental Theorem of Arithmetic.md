#### $\thm$ â€“ Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every nonzero integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ can be written as a product of primes: there are distinct prime integers $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ and integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n \geqslant 1$ such that $$n = p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_n^{a_n}.$$Moreover, such a a product is unique up to sign and the order of the factors.
