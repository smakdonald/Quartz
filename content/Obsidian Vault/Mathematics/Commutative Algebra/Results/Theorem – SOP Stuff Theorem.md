#### $\thm$ â€“ SOP Stuff Theorem
Let $(R,\m)$ be a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]] [[Local Ring|local ring]], and $x_1,\dots,x_t\in \m$.
(a) ${\dim(R/(x_1,\dots,x_t))\geqslant \dim(R)-t}.$[^1] 
(b) $x_1,\dots,x_t$ are [[System of Parameters|parameters]] if and only if $\dim(R/(x_1,\dots,x_t))=\dim(R)-t$.
(c) $x_1,\dots,x_t$ are parameters if and only if $x_1$ is not in any [[Absolutely Minimal Prime|absolutely minimal prime]] of $R$ and $x_i$ is not contained in any absolutely minimal prime of $R/(x_1,\dots,x_{i-1})$ for each $i=2,\dots,t$.

##### *Proof.*
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item If $\dim(R/(x_1,\dots,x_t)) = s$, then take a system of parameters $y_1,\dots,y_s$ for $R/(x_1,\dots,x_t)$, and pull back to $R$ to get $x_1,\dots,x_t,y'_1,\dots,y'_s$ in $R$ such that the quotient of $R$ modulo the ideal generated by these elements has dimension zero. By Krull height, we get that $t+s\geqslant \dim(R)$.

\item Let $d=\dim(R)$. Suppose first that $\dim(R/(x_1,\dots,x_t))=d-t$. Then, there is a SOP  $y_1,\dots,y_{d-t}$ for $R/(x_1,\dots,x_t)$; lift back to $R$ to get a sequence of $d$ elements $x_1,\dots,x_t,y_1,\dots,y_{d-t}$ that generate an $\m$-primary ideal. This is a SOP, so $x_1,\dots,x_t$ are parameters.

On the other hand, if $x_1,\dots,x_t$, are parameters, extend to a SOP $x_1,\dots,x_d$. If $I$ is the image of $(x_{t+1},\dots,x_d)$  in $R'=R/(x_1,\dots,x_t)$, we have $R'/I$ is zero-dimensional, hence has finite length, so $\Ass_{R'}(R'/I)=\{\m\}$, and $I$ is $\m$-primary in $R'$. Thus, $\dim(R')$ is equal to the height of $I$, which is then $\leqslant d-t$ by Krull height. That is, $\dim(R') \leqslant d-t$, and using the first statement, we have equality.

\item This follows from the previous statement and the observation that $\dim(S/(f)) < \dim(S)$ if and only if $f$ is not in any absolutely minimal prime of $S$.
