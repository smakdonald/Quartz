#### $\cor$ â€“ F.G. Algebras over Noeth Rings and Noeth
If $R$ is a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian ring]], then any [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] $R$-algebra is noetherian. In particular, any finitely generated algebra over a field is noetherian.

##### *Proof.*
Any finitely generated $R$-algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of a polynomial ring over $R$ in finitely many variables; polynomial rings over noetherian rings are noetherian, by \hyperref[hilbert basis]{Hilbert's Basis Theorem}, and quotients of noetherian rings are noetherian.
