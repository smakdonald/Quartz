#### $\thm$ â€“ Incomparability
If $R \longrightarrow S$ is [[Integral Element|integral]] and $P \subseteq Q$ are [[Prime Ideal|primes]] in $S$ that satisfy $P \cap R = Q \cap R$[^1], then $P = Q$.

##### *Proof.*
In this case we can reduce to the case of an inclusion: $f\!: R \to S$ factors through $R/\ker f$, and the map induced on Spec factors as
$$\Spec(S) \longrightarrow \Spec(R) = \Spec(S) \longrightarrow \Spec(R/\ker f) \longrightarrow \Spec(R).$$
Since the map on spectra induced by $R \longrightarrow R/\ker(f)$ is injective, we can replace $R$ by the quotient and assume $\varphi$ is an integral inclusion.

So suppose $R \subseteq S$ is integral, and let $\aprime = P \cap R = Q \cap R$. By \Cref{integral preserved by localization}, localizing at $(R\setminus \aprime)$ preserves integrality.
%We claim that localizing at $(R\setminus \p)$ preserves integrality: if $x\in S$ and $w\in R\setminus \p$, then we have equations of the form

By localizing $R$ at $(R \setminus \aprime)$, the image of $\aprime$ is a maximal ideal. So we can reduce to the situation where $R \cap P = R \cap Q$ is a maximal ideal. By \Cref{integral extension maximal contracts to maximal}, $P \subseteq Q$ are both maximal ideals. Therefore, $P = Q$.
