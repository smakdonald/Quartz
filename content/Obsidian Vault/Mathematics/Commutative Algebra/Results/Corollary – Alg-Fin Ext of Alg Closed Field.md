#### $\cor$ â€“ Alg-Fin Ext of Alg Closed Field
Let $k$ be an [[Algebraically Closed|algebraically closed]] field. If the [[Field Extension|field extension]] $k \subseteq L$ is [[Algebra Finite|algebra-finite]], then $k = L$.

##### *Proof.*
By \Cref{Zariski lemma}, $k \subseteq L$ must be module-finite.
By \Cref{module-finite implies integral}, any module-finite extension must be integral. When we are over a field, integral is the same as algebraic, but integrally closed fields have no nontrivial algebraic extensions.
