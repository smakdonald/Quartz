#### $\cor$ â€“ Direct Summand and Surj Spec Map
If $R\subseteq S$ is a [[Direct Summand|direct summand]], the map $\Spec(S) \to \Spec(R)$ is surjective.

##### *Proof.*
By \Cref{direct summand ideals contract}, we know $I S \cap R = I$ for all ideals in this case, so \Cref{image criterion} says the map on Spec is surjective.
