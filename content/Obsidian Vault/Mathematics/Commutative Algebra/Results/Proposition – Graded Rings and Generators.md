#### $\prop$ â€“ Graded Rings and Generators
Let $R$ be an $\N$-[[Graded Ring|graded ring]], with $R_0$ a field, and $M$ a $\Z$-[[Graded Module|graded module]] such that $M_{<a}=0$ for some degree $a$. A set of elements of $M$ generates $M$ if and only if their images in $M/(R_+)M$ span $M/(R_+)M$ as a [[Vector Space|vector space]] over $R_0$. Since $M$ and $(R_+)M$ are graded, $M/(R_+)M$ admits a [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] of [[Homogeneous Element|homogeneous elements]].

##### *Proof.*
Just as above, we obtain the following:
