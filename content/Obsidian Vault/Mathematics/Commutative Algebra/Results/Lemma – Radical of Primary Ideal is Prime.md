#### $\lem$ â€“ Radical of Primary Ideal is Prime
The [[Radical Ideal|radical]] of a [[Primary Ideal|primary ideal]] is [[Mathematics/Modern Algebra/Definitions/Prime|prime]].

##### *Proof.*
Suppose that $Q$ is primary and $xy \in \sqrt{Q}$. Then $x^n y^n\in Q$ for some $n$. If $y\notin \sqrt{Q}$, then $y^n\notin \sqrt{Q}$. Since $Q$ is primary, we must have $x^n\in Q$, so $x\in \sqrt{Q}$.
