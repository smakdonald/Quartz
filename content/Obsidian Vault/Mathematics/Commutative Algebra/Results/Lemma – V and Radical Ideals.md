#### $\lem$ â€“ V and Radical Ideals
Let $R$ be a ring. For any ideal $I$, $V(I)=V(\sqrt{I})$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
The containment $I \subseteq \sqrt{I}$ is immediate from the definition of radical, and thus by \Cref{properties of V} we have $V(I) \subseteq V(\sqrt{I})$. Now let $P \supseteq I$ be a prime ideal, and let $f \in \sqrt{I}$. By definition, there exists some $n$ such that $f^n \in I \subseteq P$, but since $P$ is prime, we conclude that $f \in P$. Therefore, $V(\sqrt{I}) \subseteq V(I)$, and we are done.
