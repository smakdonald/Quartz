#### $\thm$ â€“ 1st Uniqueness Theorem for Primary Decompositions
Suppose $I$ is an ideal in a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian ring]] $R$. Given any [[Primary Decomposition|irredundant primary decomposition]] of $I$, say $$I = Q_1 \cap \cdots \cap Q_t,$$we have[^1] $$\{ \sqrt{Q_1}, \ldots, \sqrt{Q_t}\}=\Ass(I).$$ In particular, this set is the same for all irredundant primary decompositions of $I$.

##### *Proof.*
For any primary decomposition, irredundant or not, by \Cref{lemma intersections primary} we have $$\Ass(I) \subseteq \bigcup_i \Ass(Q_i) = \{ \sqrt{Q_1},\dots,\sqrt{Q_t}\}.$$ We just need to show that in an irredundant decomposition as above, every $P_j :=  \sqrt{Q_j}$ is indeed an associated prime of $I$. So fix $j$, and let $$I_j = \displaystyle\bigcap_{i\neq j} Q_i \supseteq I.$$Since the decomposition is irredundant, the module $I_j/I$ is nonzero. By \Cref{associated primes nonzero}, $I_j/I$ has an associated prime, say $\mathfrak{a}$. Fix $x_j\in R$ such that $\mathfrak{a}$ is the annihilator of $x_j+I$ in $I_j/I$ for some $x_j \in I_j$. Since $$Q_j x_j \subseteq Q_j \cdot \displaystyle\bigcap_{i\neq j} Q_i \subseteq Q_1 \cap \cdots \cap Q_n = I,$$ we conclude that $Q_j \subseteq \ann(x_j+I) = \mathfrak{a}$. Since $P_j$ is the unique minimal prime of $Q_j$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ is a prime containing $Q_j$, we must have $P_j \subseteq \mathfrak{a}$. On the other hand, for any $r\in \mathfrak{a}$, we have $rx_j\in I \subseteq Q_j$, and since $x_j\notin Q_j$, we must have $r \in \sqrt{Q_j} = P_j$ by the definition of primary ideal. Thus $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq P_j$, so we can now conclude that $\mathfrak{a} = P_j$. This shows that $P_j$ is an associated prime of $I_j/I$ for all $j$. But this is a submodule of $R/I$, and thus $P_j$ is associated to $R/I$.$$\{ \sqrt{Q_1}, \ldots, \sqrt{Q_t}\}=\Ass(I).$$
