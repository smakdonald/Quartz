#### $\thm$ â€“ Noether Normalization Height and Dimension
Let $R$ be a domain that is a [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] [[Algebra|algebra]] over a field $k$, or a quotient of a power series ring over a field. Let $k[z_1,\dots,z_d]$ be any [[Noether Normalization|Noether normalization]] for $R$. For any [[Maximal Ideal|maximal ideal]] $\m$ of $R$, the length of any [[Saturated Chain of Primes|saturated chain of primes]] from $0$ to $\m$ is $d$. In particular, $\dim(R) = d$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
We will show the proof in the case when $R$ is a finitely generated domain over a field $k$; the power series case is similar, and left as an exercise. We will prove by induction on~$d$ that for any finitely generated domain with a Noether normalization with $d$ algebraically independent elements, any saturated chain of primes ending in a maximal ideal has length~$d$.

When $d=0$, $R$ is a domain that is integral over a field, hence $R$ is a field by \Cref{int ext domains field}. Now suppose the statement holds for $d-1$, and let $R$ be a finitely generated domain over some field $k$ with Noether normalization $A = k[z_1, \ldots, z_d]$. Consider a maximal ideal $\m$ of $R$ and a saturated chain $$0 \subsetneq Q_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq  Q_s = \m.$$By \hyperref[incomparability]{Incomparability}, its contraction to $A=k[z_1,\dots,z_d]$ is a chain of $s$ distinct primes in $R$: $$0 \subsetneq P_1 :=  Q_1 \cap A \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq P_s :=  Q_s \cap A.$$Our assumption that the original chain is saturated implies that $Q_1$ has height 1. Suppose that $P_1$ had height $2$ or more. By \hyperref[going down]{Going Down}, we would be able to construct a chain up to $Q_1 $ of length $2$ or more, but $Q_1$ has height $1$. Thus $P_1$ has height $1$. Since $k[z_1,\dots,z_d]$ is a UFD, $P_1=(f)$ for some prime element $f$, by \Cref{UFD height 1}. After a change of variables, as in \Cref{lemma leading term noether normalization}, we can assume that $f$ is monic in $z_d$ with coefficients in $k[z_1,\dots,z_{d-1}]$. So $k[z_1,\dots,z_{d-1}] \subseteq A/(f) \subseteq R/Q_1$ are module-finite extensions, and the induction hypothesis applies to $R/Q_1$. Now $$0 = Q_1/Q_1 \subsetneq Q_2/Q_1 \subsetneq \cdots\subsetneq Q_s/Q_1 = \m/Q_1$$is a saturated chain in the domain $R/Q_1$ going up to the maximal ideal $\m/Q_1$. The induction hypothesis then says that this chain has length $d-1$, so $k-1=d-1$, and $k=d$.
