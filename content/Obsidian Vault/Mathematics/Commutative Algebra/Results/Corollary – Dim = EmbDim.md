#### $\cor$ â€“ Dim <= EmbDim
Let $(R,\m,k)$ be a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]] [[Local Ring|local ring]]. Then 
$$\dim(R)=\min\{ n \ | \ \sqrt{(f_1,\dots,f_n)}=\m \textrm{ for some } f_1,\dots,f_n \} \leqslant \mu(\m).$$
In particular, a noetherian local ring has finite dimension.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose that $\sqrt{(f_1,\dots,f_n)}=\m$. Then $\m$ is a minimal prime of $(f_1, \ldots, f_n)$, and thus $\m$ has height at most $n$ by \hyperref[Krull height theorem]{Krull's height theorem}. The dimension of a local ring is the height of its maximal ideal, so $\dim(R) \leqslant n$, and thus $\dim(R)$ is bounded above by the minimum in the middle. On the other hand, if $d = \dim(R)$ then by \Cref{existence of sops} there exist $f_1, \ldots, f_d$ such that $\m = (f_1, \ldots, f_d)$, which gives the other inequality, showing$$\dim(R)=\min\{ n \ | \ \sqrt{(f_1,\dots,f_n)}=\m \textrm{ for some } f_1,\dots,f_n \}.$$Finally, since $\m$ is generated by $\mu(\m)$ elements, there are in particular $\mu(\m)$ elements whose radical is $\m$.
