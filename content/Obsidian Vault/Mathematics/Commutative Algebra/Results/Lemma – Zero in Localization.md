#### $\lem$ â€“ Zero in Localization
Let $M$ be an $R$-module, and $W$ a [[Multiplicatively Closed Set|multiplicative set]]. Then[^1]$$\frac{m}{w}\in W^{-1}M \ \text{ is zero} \ \iff \  vm=0 \textrm{ for some } v\in W \ \iff \ \ann_R(m) \cap W \neq \varnothing.$$Note in particular that this holds for $w=1$.

##### *Proof.*
For the first equivalence, we use the equivalence relation defining $W^{-1}R$ to note that $\frac{m}{w}=\frac{0}{1}$ in $W^{-1}M$ if and only if there exists some $v\in W$ such that $0=v(1m-0w)=vm$. The second equivalence just comes from the definition of the annihilator.
