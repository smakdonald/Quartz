#### $\prop$ – F.G.-by-Intl-Modfin
Consider a ring extension $A\subseteq R$. 
(a) If $r \in R$ is [[Integral Element|integral]] over $A$, then $A[r]$ is [[Module Finite|module-finite]] over $A$.
(b) If $r_1,\dots,r_t \in R$ are integral over $A$, then $A[r_1,\dots,r_t]$ is module-finite over $A$.

##### *Proof.*
(a) Let $r$ be integral over $A$, with $r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0$ for some $a_i \in A$. We claim that $A[r] = A + Ar + \cdots + A r^{n-1}$. Since $A[r]$ is generated by all the powers $r^m$ of $r$ as an $A$-module, to show that any polynomial $p(r) \in A[r]$ is in $A + Ar + \cdots + A r^{n-1}$ it is enough to show that $r^m \in A + Ar + \cdots + A r^{n-1}$ for all $m$. 

Using induction on $m$, the base cases $1, r, \ldots, r^{n-1} \in A + Ar + \cdots + A r^{n-1}$ are obvious. For the induction step, we need to show that $r^m \in A + Ar + \cdots + A r^{n-1}$ for all $m \geqslant n-1$; we can do this by induction because we can use the equation above to rewrite $r^m$ as $$\begin{aligned}r^m & = - r^{m-n}(a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0) \\& = - a_{n-1} r^{m-1} - \cdots a_1 r^{m-n+1} - a_0 r^{m-n},\end{aligned}$$ which is a [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of powers of $r$ of degree up to $m-1$.

(b) Write $$A_0 :=  A \subseteq A_1 :=  A[r_1] \subseteq A_2 :=  A[r_1,r_2] \subseteq \cdots \subseteq A_t :=  A[r_1,\dots,r_t].$$Since $r_i$ is integral over $A$, it is also integral over $A_{i-1}$, via the same monic equation that $r_i$ satisfies over $A$. By Part (a), we conclude that the each extension $A_{i-1} \subseteq A_i$ is module-finite. Thus the inclusion $A \subseteq A[r_1,\dots,r_t]$ is a composition of module-finite maps, and thus by this [[Lemma – Mod-Fin-Compose|Lemma]] it is also module-finite.
