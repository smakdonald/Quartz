#### $\prop$ â€“ GNAK1
Let $R$ be an $\N$-[[Graded Ring|graded ring]], and $M$ a $\Z$-[[Graded Module|graded module]] such that $M_{<a}=0$ for some $a$. If $M= (R_+) M$, then $M=0$. 

##### *Proof.*
If $M \neq 0$, then $M$ has a nonzero homogeneous element. Suppose $M_a \neq 0$. On the one hand, the homogeneous elements in $M$ live in degrees at least $a$, but $(R_+)M$ lives in degrees strictly bigger than $a$. Thus $(R_+)M \neq M$.
