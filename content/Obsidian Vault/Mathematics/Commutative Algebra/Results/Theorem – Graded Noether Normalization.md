#### $\thm$ â€“ Graded Noether Normalization
Let $k$ be an infinite field, and $R$ be a [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] $\N$-[[Graded Ring|graded]] $k$-[[Algebra|algebra]] with $R_0=k$ and $R=k[R_1]$. There are [[Homogeneous Element|homogeneous elements]] $x_1,\dots,x_t\in R_1$ algebraically independent over $k$ such that $R$ is [[Module Finite|module-finite]] over $k[x_1,\dots,x_t]$.

##### *Proof.*
We repeat the proof of \Cref{Noether normalization} but use \Cref{lemma leading term noether normalization graded version} in place of \Cref{lemma leading term noether normalization}.
