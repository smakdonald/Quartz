#### $\cor$ â€“ Integral Elements form Subring
Given any ring extension $A\subseteq S$, the set of elements of $S$ that are [[Integral Element|integral]] over $A$ form a subring of $S$.

##### *Proof.*
By \Cref{extensions gen by integral elements are integral}, the $A$-subalgebra of $R$ generated by all elements in $R$ that are integral over $A$ is integral over $A$, so it is contained in the set of all elements that are integral over $A$: this means that $$ \{\text{integral elements}\} \subseteq A[\{\text{integral elements}\}] \subseteq \{\text{integral elements}\}, $$so equality holds throughout, and $\{\text{integral elements}\}$ is a ring.
