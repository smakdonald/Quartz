#### $\lem$ â€“ Prime Avoidance
Let $R$ be a ring, $I_1,\dots,I_n,J$ be ideals, and suppose that $I_i$ is [[Prime Ideal|prime]] for $i>2$. If $J\not\subseteq I_i$ for all $i$, then $J\not\subseteq \bigcup_i I_i$. Equivalently, if $J\subseteq \bigcup_i I_i$, then $J\subseteq I_i$ for some $i$.

Moreover, if $R$ is $\N$-[[Graded Ring|graded]], and all of the ideals are [[Homogeneous Ideal|homogeneous]], all $I_i$ are prime, and $J\not\subseteq I_i$ for all $i$, then there is a [[Homogeneous Element|homogeneous]] element in $J$ that is not in $\bigcup_i I_i$.

##### *Proof.*
We proceed by induction on $n$. If $n=1$, there is nothing to show.
When $n=2$, we have two ideals $I_1$ and $I_2$ and an ideal $J$ such that $J \nsubseteq I_1$ and $J \nsubseteq I_2$, and we want to show that $J \nsubseteq I_1 \cup I_2$. By assumption. there exist elements $a_1, a_2 \in J$ with $a_1 \notin I_1$ and $a_2 \notin I_2$. If $a_2 \notin I_1$ or $a_1 \notin I_2$, then we have an element that is not in $I_1 \cup I_2$, and we are done. On the other hand, if $a_2 \in I_1$ and $a_1 \in I_2$, then consider $c = a_1 + a_2 \in J$. Since $a_1 \in I_1$ but $a_2 \notin I_1$, then $c \notin I_1$. Similarly, $c \notin I_2$. Therefore, $c \notin I_1 \cup I_2$.

Now suppose that the statement holds for some $n-1 \geqslant 2$, and consider ideals $I_1, \ldots, I_{n}$ with $I_i$ prime for all $i \geqslant 3$ such that $J \notin I_i$ for any $i$. By induction hypothesis, for each $i$ we have $$J \notin \bigcup_{j \neq i} I_j,$$so we can find elements $a_i$ such that $$a_i \notin \bigcup_{j\neq i} I_j \textrm{ and } a_i \in J.$$ If some $a_i\notin I_i$, we are done, so let's assume that $a_i\in I_i$ for each $i$. Consider $$a :=  a_n + a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} \in J.$$ Notice that $a_1\cdots a_{n-1}=a_i(a_1\cdots \widehat{a_i} \cdots a_{n-1})\in I_i$. If $a\in I_i$ for $i<n$, then we also have $a_n\in I_i$, a contradiction. If $a\in I_n$, then we also have $a_1\cdots a_{n-1} = a - a_n \in I_n$, since $a_n\in I_n$. Since $n>2$, our assumption is that $I_n$ is prime, so one of $a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}\in I_n$, which is a contradiction. So $a \notin I_i$ for all $i$, and thus $a$ is the element we were searching for.

If all $I_i$ are homogeneous and prime, then we proceed as above but replacing $a_n$ and $a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}$ with suitable powers so that $a_n + a_1 \cdots a_{n-1}$ is homogeneous. For example, we could take$$a :=  a_n^{\deg(a_1) + \cdots + \deg(a_{n-1})} + \left( a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} \right)^{\deg(a_n)}.$$The primeness assumption guarantees that noncontainments in ideals is preserved.
