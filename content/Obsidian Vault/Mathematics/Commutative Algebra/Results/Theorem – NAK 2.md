#### $\thm$ â€“ NAK 2
Let $(R,\m,k)$ be a [[Local Ring|local ring]], and $M$ be a finitely generated module. If $M=\m M$, then $M=0$.

##### *Proof.*
By \Cref{NAK1}, there exists an element $r\in 1+\m$ that annihilates $M$. Notice that $1 \notin \m$, so any such $r$ must be outside of $\m$, and thus a unit. Multiplying by its inverse, we conclude that $1$ annihilates $M$, or equivalently, that $M=0$.
