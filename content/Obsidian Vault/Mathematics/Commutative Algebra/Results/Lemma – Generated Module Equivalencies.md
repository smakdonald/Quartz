#### $\lem$ – Generated Module Equivalencies
The following are equivalent:

(a) $\Gamma$ [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Submodule|generates]] $M$ as an $R$-module.
(b) Every element of $M$ can be written as a finite [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of the elements of $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $R$.
(c) The homomorphism $\t : R^{\oplus Y}\to M$ , where $R^{\oplus Y}$ is a [[Basis and Free Module|free]] $R$-module with [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] $Y$ in bijection with $\Gamma$ via $\t(y_{i}) = \g_{i}$, is surjective.[^1]

##### *Proof.*
###### (a $\Longleftrightarrow$ b)
Suppose $\Gamma$ generates $M$ as an $R$-module. The definition of a generated submodule is that it is the smallest submodule containing all linear combinations of the generators of $\Gamma$. Thus every element of $M$ can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of $\Gamma$. 

Similarly, if every element of $M$ can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of $\Gamma$, then the submodule generated by $\Gamma$ is $M$ itself. 
###### (b $\Longrightarrow$ c)
Suppose every element of $M$ can be written as a finite linear combination of the elements of $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $R$, and let $\t : R^{\oplus Y}\to M$ be defined as above. Let $x\in M$. Thus $m$ can be written in the form $r_{1}m_{1}+\dots+r_{n}m_{n}$, where $r_{i}\in R$ and and $m_{i}\in\Gamma$. As $Y$ is in bijection with $\Gamma$, we see that there exist $y_{i}\in Y$ such that $\t(y_{i})=m_{i}$ for each $1\leq i\leq n$. Thus the element $r_{1}y_{1}+\dots+r_{n}y_{n}$ maps to $x$ via $\t$. 
###### (c $\Longrightarrow$ b)
Suppose the homomorphism $\t : R^{\oplus Y}\to M$ , where $R^{\oplus Y}$ is a [[Basis and Free Module|free]] $R$-module with [[Basis and Free Module|basis]] $Y$ in bijection with $\Gamma$ via $\t(y_{i}) = \g_{i}$, is surjective. Thus for any $x\in M$ there exists some $y\in R^{\oplus Y}$ such that $\t(y)=x$. As $Y$ is a basis for $R^{\oplus Y}$ there exist $y_{i}\in Y$ such that $y=r_{1}y_{1}+\dots+r_{n}y_{n}$. As $\t$ is a homomorphism, we see that $$\begin{align*}
x&=\t(y)\\
&=\t(r_{1}y_{1}+\dots+r_{n}y_{n})\\
&=\t(r_{1})m_{1}+\dots+\t(r_{n})m_{n},
\end{align*}$$where each $m_{i}\in\Gamma$ and each $\t(r_{i})\in R$. Thus every element of $M$ can be written as a finite linear combination of  elements of $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $R$.

[^1]: :$\rem$ The equivalence between 1) and 2) says that the [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Submodule|submodule generated]] by $\Gamma$ is exactly the set of all finite [[Linear Combination|linear combinations]] of elements in $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $R$, which explains the notation $\sum_{m\in\Gamma}Rm$.
