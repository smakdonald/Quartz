#### $\prop$ â€“ Group Ring and Automorphisms Mod-Fin
Let $k$ be a field, $R$ be a [[Algebra Finite|finitely-generated]] $k$-algebra, and $G$ a finite group of automorphisms of $R$ that fix $k$. Then $R^G \subseteq R$ is [[Module Finite|module-finite]].

##### *Proof.*
By \Cref{characterization of mod-fin alg-fin integral}, integral and algebra-finite implies module-finite, so we will show that $R$ is algebra-finite and integral over $R^G$.

First, since $k\subseteq R^G$ and $R$ is generated finitely generated $k$-algebra, it is generated by the same finite set as an $R^G$-algebra as well. Thus $R^G \subseteq R$ is algebra-finite.

To show that $R^G \subseteq R$ is integral, let us first extend the action of $G$ on $R$ to $R[t]$ trivially, meaning that we will let $G$ fix $t$. Given $r\in R$, consider the polynomial 
$$F_r(t) :=  \prod_{g\in G} (t-g \cdot r) \in R[t].$$ 
Now $G$ fixes $F_r(t)$, since for each $h \in G$,
$$h \cdot F_r(t) = h \prod_{g\in G} (t-g \cdot r) = \prod_{g\in G} (h \cdot t-(hg) \cdot r) = F_r(t)$$
Thus, $F_r(t)\in (R[t])^{G}$. Notice that $(R[t])^G = R^G[t]$, since 
$$g (a_nt^n + \cdots + a_0) = a_nt^n + \cdots + a_0 \implies (g \cdot a_n)t^n + \cdots + (g \cdot a_0) = a_nt^n + \cdots + a_0.$$
Therefore, $F_r(t) \in R^G[t]$. The leading term (with respect to $t$) of $F_r(t)$ is $t^{|G|}$, so $F_r(t)$ is monic. On the other hand, one of the factors of $F_r(t)$ is $(t-r)$, so $F_r(r) = 0$. Therefore, $r$ satisfies a monic polynomial with coefficients in $R^G$, and thus $R$ is integral over $R^G$.
