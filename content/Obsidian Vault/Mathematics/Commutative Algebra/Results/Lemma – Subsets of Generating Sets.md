#### $\lem$ – Subsets of Generating Sets
(a) If $M$ is a [[Finitely Generated Module|finitely generated]] $R$-[[Module|module]], then any [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Submodule|generating set]] for $M$ as an $R$-module contains a finite subset that generates $M$.
(b) If the ring $S$ is [[Algebra Finite|algebra-finite]] over $R$, then any generating set for $S$ as an $R$-algebra contains a finite subset that also generates $S$ as an $R$-[[Algebra|algebra]].

##### *Proof.*
Let $\Gamma$ be a generating set for $M$ as an $R$-module. If $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, then we can find elements $f_1 \ldots, f_r$ that generate $M$ as an $R$-module. Since $\Gamma$ generates $M$, for each $i$ we can find finitely many elements $\gamma_{i,1}, \ldots, \gamma_{i,n_i} \in \Gamma$ and $R$-coefficients $r_{i,1}, \ldots, r_{i,n_i}$ such $$f_i = r_{i,1} \gamma_{i,1} + \cdots + r_{i,n_i} \gamma_{i,n_i}.$$The submodule $N$ of $M$ [[Generator#$ defn$ – Generated Submodule|generated]] by all the $\gamma_{i,j}$ contains the elements $f_1, \ldots, f_n$, but since $M = Rf_1 + \cdots + f_n$, we conclude that $M$ is generated by those finitely many $\gamma_{i,j}$, and thus by a finite subset of $\Gamma$. 

The other proof is essentially the same, with the appropriate replacements: whenever we talk about a set that generates $M$ as an $R$-module, we should instead consider a set that generates $S$ as an $R$-algebra, and instead of taking linear combinations of elements we should consider polynomials in those elements with $R$-coefficients.
