#### $\thm$ â€“ Associated Primes Nonzero
If $R$ is [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]], and $M$ is an arbitrary $R$-module, then[^1] $$\Ass(M)= \varnothing \Longleftrightarrow M=0.$$ If $R$ and $M$ are $\Z$-[[Graded Ring|graded]] and $M\neq 0$, then $M$ has an [[Associated Prime|associated prime]] that is [[Homogeneous Ideal|homogeneous]].

##### *Proof.*
Even if $R$ is not noetherian, $M = 0$ implies $\Ass(M) = \varnothing$ by definition. So we focus on the case when $M \neq 0$. If $M \neq 0$, then $M$ contains a nonzero element $m$, and $\ann(m)$ is contained in an associated prime of $M$, by \Cref{every ann contained in ass prime}. In particular, $\Ass(M) \neq 0$. In the graded setting, \Cref{every ann contained in ass prime} gives us a homogeneous associated prime.
