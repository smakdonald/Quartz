#### $\thm$ â€“ NAK 4
Let $(R,\m,k)$ be a [[Local Ring|local ring]], and $M$ be a finitely generated module. For $m_1,\dots,m_s\in M$, $$m_1,\dots, m_s \text{ generate } M \Longleftrightarrow \overline{m_1},\dots,\overline{m_s} \text{ generate } M/\m M.$$ Thus, any generating set for $M$ consists of at least $\dim_k (M/\m M)$ elements.

##### *Proof.*
The implication $(\implies)$ is clear. If $m_1,\dots, m_s \in M$ are such that $\overline{m_1},\dots,\overline{m_s}$ generate $M/\m M$, consider $N= R m_1 + \dots + R m_s \subseteq M$. Since $M/\m M$ is generated by the image of $N$, we have $M= N + \m M$. By \Cref{NAK2}, $M=N$.
