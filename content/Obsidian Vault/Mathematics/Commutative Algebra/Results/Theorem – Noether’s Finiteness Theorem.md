#### $\thm$ – Noether’s Finiteness Theorem
Let $k$ be a field, $R$ be a [[Polynomial Ring|polynomial ring]] over $k$, and $G$ be a finite group [[Group Action|acting]] $k$-linearly on $R$. Then $R^G$ is a [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] $k$-[[Algebra|algebra]].

##### *Proof.*
Observe that $k \subseteq R^G \subseteq R$, that $k$ is noetherian, $k\subseteq R$ is algebra-finite, and $R^G\subseteq R$ is module-finite. The desired result is now a corollary of the \hyperref[artin tate]{Artin-Tate Lemma}.
