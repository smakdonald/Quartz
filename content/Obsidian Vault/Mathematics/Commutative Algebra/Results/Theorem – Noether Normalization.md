#### $\thm$ â€“ Noether Normalization
Let $A$ be a domain, and $R$ be a [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] $A$-[[Algebra|algebra]]. There is some nonzero $a\in A$ and $x_1,\dots,x_t\in R$ algebraically independent over $A$ such that $R_a$ is [[Module Finite|module-finite]] over $A_a[x_1,\dots,x_t]$. 

In particular, if $k$ is a field and $R$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, then there exist $x_1, \ldots, x_t \in R$ algebraically independent over $k$ such that $k[x_1,\ldots,x_t] \subseteq R$ is module-finite.

##### *Proof.*
We proceed by induction on the number of algebra generators $n$ of $R$ over $A$. There is nothing to prove in the case when $n=0$.

Now suppose that we know the result holds for $A$-algebras generated by at most $n-1$ elements, and let $R=A[r_1,\dots,r_n]$. If $r_1,\dots,r_n$ are algebraically independent over $A$, we are done: $R$ is module-finite over $R = A[r_1,\dots,r_n]$. If not, there is some algebraic relation among the generators $r_1, \ldots, r_n$, meaning there exists $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) \in A[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ such that $f(r_1,\dots,r_n)=0$. After possibly applying \Cref{lemma leading term noether normalization} to change our choice of algebra generators, we can assume that $f$ has leading term $a x_n^N$ for some $a$. Then $f$ is monic in $x_n$ after inverting $a$, so $r_n$ is integral over $A_a[r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}]$, and thus $R_a$ is module-finite over $A_a[r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}]$ by \Cref{characterization of mod-fin alg-fin integral}. By hypothesis, $A_{ab}[r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}]$ is module-finite over $A_{ab}[x_1,\dots,x_s]$ for some $b\in A$ and $x_1,\dots,x_s$ that are algebraically independent over $A$. Since $R_{ab}$ is module-finite over $A_{ab}[r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}]$, then by \Cref{remark composition algfin} $R_{ab}$ must also be module-finite over $A_{ab}[x_1,\dots,x_s]$, and we are done.
