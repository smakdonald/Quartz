#### $\thm$ â€“ Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem
Let $R$ be a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian ring]], and $f\in R$. Then, every [[Minimal Prime|minimal prime]] of $(f)$ has [[Height of an Ideal|height]] at most one.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose the theorem is false, so that there is some ring $R$, a prime $P$, and an element $f$ such that $P$ is minimal over $(f)$ and $\height(P)>1$. If we localize at $P$ and then mod out by an appropriate minimal prime, we obtain a noetherian local domain $(R,\m)$ of dimension at least two in which $\m$ is the unique minimal prime of $(f)$. Let's work over that noetherian local domain $(R, \m)$. Note that $\overline{R} = R/(f)$ is zero-dimensional, since $\m$ is the only minimal prime over $(f)$. Back in $R$, let $Q$ be a prime strictly in between $(0)$ and $\m$, and notice that we necessarily have $f \notin Q$.

Consider the symbolic powers $Q^{(n)}$ of $Q$. We will show that these stabilize in $R$. Since $\overline{R} = R/(f)$ is Artinian, the descending chain of ideals $$Q \overline{R} \supseteq Q^{(2)}\overline{R} \supseteq Q^{(3)}\overline{R} \supseteq \cdots$$stabilizes. We then have some $n$ such that $Q^{(n)} \overline{R} = Q^{(m)} \overline{R}$ for all $m \geqslant n$, and in particular, $Q^{(n)} \overline{R} = Q^{(n+1)} \overline{R}$. Pulling back to $R$, we get $Q^{(n)} \subseteq Q^{(n+1)} + (f)$. Then any element $a \in Q^{(n)}$ can be written as $a = b + fr$, where $b \in Q^{(n+1)} \subseteq Q^{(n)}$ and $r \in R$. Notice that this implies that $fr \in Q^{(n)}$. Since $f\notin Q$, we must have $r\in Q^{(n)}$. This yields $Q^{(n)} = \q^{(n+1)} + f \q^{(n)}$. Thus, $Q^{(n)} / Q^{(n+1)} = f(Q^{(n)} / \q^{(n+1)})$, so $Q^{(n)} / Q^{(n+1)} = \m(Q^{(n)} / Q^{(n+1)})$. By \hyperref[NAK2]{NAK}, $Q^{(n)} = Q^{(n+1)}$ in $R$. Similarly, we obtain $Q^{(n)} = Q^{(m)}$ for all $m \geqslant n$.

Now, if $a \in Q$ is nonzero, we have $a^n\in Q^n \subseteq Q^{(n)} = Q^{(m)}$ for all $m$, so $$\bigcap_{m \geqslant 1} Q^{(m)} = \bigcap_{m \geqslant n} Q^{(m)} = Q^{(n)}.$$Notice that $Q^n \neq 0$ because $R$ is a domain, and so $Q^{(n)} \supseteq Q^n$ is also nonzero. So$$\bigcap_{m \geqslant 1} Q^{(m)} = Q^{(n)} \neq 0.$$On the other hand, $Q^{(m)} = Q^m R_Q \cap R$ for all $m$, and $$\bigcap_{m \geqslant 1} Q^{(m)} R_Q \subseteq \bigcap_{m \geqslant 1} Q^m R_{Q} = \bigcap_{m \geqslant 1} (Q R_{Q})^m = 0$$ by \hyperref[Krull intersection theorem]{Krull's Intersection theorem}. Since $R$ is a domain, the contraction of $(0)$ in $R_Q$ back in $R$ is $(0)$. This is the contradiction we seek. So no such $Q$ exists, so that $R$ has dimension $1$, and in the original ring, all the minimal primes over $f$ must have height at most $1$.
