#### $\cor$ â€“ Extensions Gen by Integral Elements are Integral
If $R$ is generated as an algebra over $A$ by [[Integral Element|integral]] elements, then $R$ is [[Integral Element|integral]] over $A$. 

##### *Proof.*
Let $R=A[\Lambda]$, with $\lambda$ integral over $A$ for all $\lambda\in\Lambda$. Given $r\in R$, there is a finite subset $L\subseteq \Lambda$ such that $r\in A[L]$. This $A[L]$ is now a finitely-generated algebra generated by integral elements, and thus by \Cref{characterization of mod-fin alg-fin integral} it must be module-finite over $A$. By \Cref{module-finite implies integral}, module-finite implies integral, and thus $A[L]$ is an integral extension of $A$. In particular, $r \in A[L]$ is integral over $A$.
