#### $\cor$ â€“ Dimension of Polynomial Ring
The [[Krull Dimension of a Ring|dimension]] of the [[Polynomial Ring|polynomial ring]] $k[x_1,\dots,x_d]$ is $d$.

##### *Proof.*
The polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_d]$ is a Noether normalization of itself, so \Cref{Noether normalization height and dimension} says that it must have dimension $d$.
