#### $\lem$ â€“ Min Gen Sets have Same Cardinality
Let $(R,\m,k)$ be a [[Local Ring|local ring]] and $M$ be a finitely generated module. Any generating set for $M$ contains a [[Minimal Generators|minimal generating set]], and every minimal generating set has the same cardinality.

##### *Proof.*
As a consequence of basic facts about basis for vector spaces, we conclude the following:
