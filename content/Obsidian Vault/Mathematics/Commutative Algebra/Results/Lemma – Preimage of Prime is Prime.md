#### $\lem$ â€“ Preimage of Prime is Prime
Let $R \xrightarrow{\varphi} S$ be a ring homomorphism and $P \subset S$ be [[Prime Ideal|prime]] #eltypo . Then $P \cap R$[^1] is also prime.

##### *Proof.*
Let $P$ be a prime ideal in $S$. Given elements $f, g \in R$ such that $fg \in P \cap R$, then $\varphi(f)\varphi(g)=\varphi(fg) \in P$, and since $P$ is prime, we conclude that $\varphi(f) \in P$ or $\varphi(g) \in P$. Therefore, $f \in P \cap R$ or $g \in P \cap R$.
