#### $\lem$ â€“ Local if Nonunits Form an Ideal
A ring $R$ is [[Local Ring|local]] if and only if the set of non-[[Unit|units]] of $R$ forms an ideal.

##### *Proof.*
If $R$ is a local with maximal ideal $\m$, then every nonunit must be in $\m$, and $\m$ contains no nonunits, so $\m$ must be the set of nonunits. Conversely, if the set of nonunits is an ideal, that must be the only maximal ideal, since any other element in $R$ is a unit.
