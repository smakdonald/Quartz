#### $\prop$ â€“ UMP of Localizations
Let $R$ be a ring, and $W$ a [[Multiplicatively Closed Set|multiplicative set]] with $0\notin W$. Let $S$ be an $R$-[[Algebra|algebra]] in which every element of $W$ is a [[Unit|unit]]. Then there is a unique homomorphism $\alpha$ such that the following diagram commutes:$$\begin{CD}
R@>>>W\inv R\\
@VVV \\ 
S
\end{CD}$$ #fix where the vertical map is the [[Algebra|structure homomorphism]] and the horizontal map is the [[Canonical Map|canonical]] homomorphism.
