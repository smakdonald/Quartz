#### $\defn$ â€“ Height of an Ideal
The *height* of a [[Prime Ideal|prime ideal]] $P$ in a ring $R$ is the supremum of the lengths of [[Saturated Chain of Primes|saturated chains of primes]] in $R$ that end in $P$:
$$\height(P) :=  \sup \{ h \mid \exists \text{ a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals } Q_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Q_h = P \}.$$
The *height* of an ideal $I$ is the infimum of the heights of the primes containing $I$:
$$ \height(I) :=  \inf \{ \height(P) \mid P \in V(I) \} = \inf \{ \height(P) \mid P \in \Min(I)\}.$$
