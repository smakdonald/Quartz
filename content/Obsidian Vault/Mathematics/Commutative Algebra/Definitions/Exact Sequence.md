#### $\defn$ â€“ Exact Sequence
An *exact sequence* of $R$-[[Module|modules]] is a sequence $$\begin{CD}
\dots@>f_{n-1}>>M_{n}@>f_{n}>>M_{n+1}@>f_{n+1}>>\dots
\end{CD}$$
of $R$-[[Module|modules]] and $R$-module [[Homomorphism|homomorphisms]] such that $\im f_n = \ker f_{n+1}$[^1] for all $n$. An exact sequence of the form
$$\begin{CD}
0@>>>A@>>>B@>>>C@>>>0
\end{CD}$$
is called a *short exact sequence*.
