#### $\defn$ – Minimal Prime
Let $I$ be an [[Ideal|ideal]] in a [[Ring|ring]] $R$. A [[Prime Ideal|prime]] $P$ is a *minimal prime* of $I$ if $P$ is minimal in $V(I)$[^1]. A *minimal prime* of $R$ is a minimal element in $\Spec(R)$[^2].

#### $\defn$ – Minimal Prime
Let $I$ be an ideal in a ring $R$. A *minimal prime* of $I$ is a minimal element (with respect to containment) in $V(I)$. More precisely, $P$ is a minimal prime of $I$ if the following hold:
-  $P$ is a prime ideal,
- $P \supseteq I$, and
- if $Q$ is also a prime ideal and $I \subseteq Q \subseteq P$, then $Q = P$.
The set of minimal primes of $I$ is denoted $\Min(I)$.
