#### $\defn$ â€“ Local Ring
A [[Ring|ring]] $R$ is a *local ring* if it has exactly one [[Maximal Ideal|maximal ideal]]. We often use the notation $(R,\m)$ to denote $R$ and its maximal ideal, or $(R,\m,k)$ to also specify the [[Residue Field|residue field]] $k=R/\m$.

Some people reserve the term *local ring* for a [[Noetherian Ring|noetherian]] local ring, and call what we have defined a *quasilocal* ring; we will not follow this convention here.
