#### $\defn$ – Free Algebra
Suppose $\Lambda$ [[Generated Algebra|generates]] $S$ as an $R$-[[Algebra|algebra]]. Let $R[X]$ be a [[Polynomial Ring|polynomial ring]] on a set of indeterminates $X$ in bijection with $\Lambda$, and let $\pi$ denote the $R$-algebra homomorphism $$\begin{CD}
R[X]^{n}@>\pi>> S\\\\
x_{i}@>>> \l_{i}
\end{CD}$$If the homomorphism $\pi$ is injective (and thus an isomorphism[^1]) we say that $S$ is a *free algebra*; a free algebra on $R$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring on $R$. 

The ideal $I = \ker(\pi)$ measures how far $R$ is from being a free $R$-algebra and is called the set of *relations* on $\Lambda$.

[^1]: From this [[Lemma – Generated Algebra Equivalencies|Lemma]] we see that $\Lambda$ generating $S$ as an $R$-algebra is equivalent to the surjectivity of $\pi$.
