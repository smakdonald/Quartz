#### $\defn$ â€“ Noether Normalization
Let $R$ be a [[Algebra Finite|finitely generated]] [[Algebra|algebra]] for some field $k$. Then a *Noether normalization* of $R$ is a [[Polynomial Ring|polynomial ring]] $A=k[x_1,\ldots, x_t]\subseteq R$[^1] such that $x_1,\ldots, x_t$ are algebraically independent over $k$ and $R$ is [[Module Finite|module-finite]] over $A$.
