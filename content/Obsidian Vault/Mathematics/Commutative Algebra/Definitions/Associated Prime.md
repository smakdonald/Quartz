#### $\defn$ – Associated Prime
Let $R$ be a [[Ring|ring]] and $M$ an $R$-[[Module|module]]. We say that $P \in \Spec(R)$[^1] is an *associated* [[Prime Ideal|prime]] of $M$ if $P = \ann_R(m)$[^2] for some $m \in M$. Equivalently, $P$ is associated to $M$ if there is an injective [[Homomorphism#$ defn$ – $R$-Module Homomorphism|homomorphism]] $R/P \longrightarrow M$. We write $\Ass_R(M)$ for the set of associated primes of $M$.	

If $I$ is an [[Ideal|ideal]], by the *associated primes* of $I$ we (almost always) mean the associated primes of the $R$-module $R/I$.
