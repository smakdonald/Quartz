#### $\defn$ – Noetherian Ring
A ring $R$ is *noetherian* if every ascending chain of ideals 
$$I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 \subseteq \cdots$$
eventually stabilizes: there is some $N$ for which $I_n=I_{n+1}$ for all $n \geqslant N$.

#### $\defn$ – Noetherian Ring
Suppose $R$ is a commutative [[Ring|ring]]. Then $R$ is called a *noetherian ring* if
$R$ satisfies the [[Ascending Chain Condition|ascending chain condition]] on ideals – i.e., for every chain of [[Ideal|ideals]] of $R$
$$I_1 \subseteq I_2  \subseteq I_3 \subseteq \cdots$$
there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $I_n = I_{n+1} = I_{n+2} = \cdots=I_{n+k}$ for all $k\geq 0$.
