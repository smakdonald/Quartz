#### $\defn$ â€“ Direct Summand
Let $\varphi\!:R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. We say that $R$ is a *direct summand* of $S$ if the map $\varphi$ *splits* as a map of $R$-modules, meaning there is an $R$-module homomorphism $$\begin{CD}
R@>\varphi>> S\\\\
R@<<\rho< S
\end{CD}$$ such that $\rho \varphi$ is the identity on $R$.
