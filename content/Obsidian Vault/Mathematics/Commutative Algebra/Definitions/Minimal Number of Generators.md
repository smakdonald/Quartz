#### $\defn$ – Minimal Number of Generators
Let $(R,\m)$ be a [[Local Ring|local ring]] and $N$ an $R$-[[Module|module]]. The *minimal number of generators* of $M$ is $$\mu(M) :=  \dim_{R/\m} \left( M / \m M \right).$$Equivalently, this is the number of elements in a [[Minimal Generators|minimal generating set]] for $M$.

#### $\defn$ – Minimal Number of Generators (Graded)
Let $R$ be an $\N$-[[Graded Ring|graded]] ring with $R_0$ a field, and $M$ a finitely generated $\Z$-graded $R$-module. The *minimal number of generators* of $M$ is $$\mu(M) :=  \dim_{R/R_+} \left( M / R_+ M \right).$$
