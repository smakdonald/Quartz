#### $\defn$ – Divides (Commutative Ring)
Given a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Ring|ring]] $R$ and elements $\a, \beta \in R$, we say that $\a$ *divides* $\beta$, 
and write $\a | \beta$, if there exists $\g \in R$ such that $\beta = \a \g$.

#### $\defn$ – Divisible (Integers)
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. The number $a$ *divides* the number $b$ if there is some integer $q$ such that $aq = b$. If $a$ divides $b$, we write $a|b$, and we say that $a$ is a *factor* of $b$, and that $b$ is *divisible* by $a$.
