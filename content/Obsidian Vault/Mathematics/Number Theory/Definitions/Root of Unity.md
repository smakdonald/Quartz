#### $\defn$ â€“ Root of Unity
Given a [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Definitions/Natural Numbers|natural number]] $n$, an $n\th$ *root of unity* is a [[Complex Numbers|complex number]] $z$ such that 
$z^{n} = 1$. An $n\th$ root of unity $z$ is *primitive* if $z^{m}\neq1$ for all natural numbers $m < n$.
