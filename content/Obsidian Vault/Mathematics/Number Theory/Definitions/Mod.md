#### $\defn$ – Mod
Let $a, b, q$, and $r$ be as in the [[Theorem – The Division Algorithm|Division Algorithm]]. We define $a \mod b$ by putting $r = a \mod b$, pronounced “$a$ *modulo* $b$” or “$a$ *mod* $b$.” Here we call the number $b$ the *modulus*. Note that $a | b ⇐⇒ b \mod a = 0 ⇐⇒ b = ak$ (for some $k \in\Z$), a handy dictionary of equivalences for translating between different types of statements in the middle of a proof.

#### $\defn$ – Mod (Gaussian)
Given $\beta = 0 \in\Z[i]$, define the equivalence relation congruence$\mod \beta$ on $\Z[i]$ 
as follows: for $\mu, \nu \in\Z[i]$, we have $$\mu \equiv \nu \mod \beta \Longleftrightarrow\beta | (\mu - \nu).$$A system of coset representatives modulo $\beta$ is a choice of one element from 
each equivalence class. Given such a system, for $\mu \in\Z[i]$ the symbol $\mu \mod \beta$ 
denotes the unique element of this system to which $\mu$ is congruent.
