#### $\defn$ – $\Zm n$
For an [[Integers|integer]] $n > 1$, the *ring of integers modulo* $n$, $\Z/(n)$, is defined by $$\Z/(n) = \{[0], [1], \dots  , [n - 1]\},$$where $[a]$ denotes the [[Equivalence Class|equivalence class]] of a [[Mod|modulo]] $n$, i.e., the set of integers that have the same [[Theorem – The Division Algorithm|remainder]] as a when [[Theorem – The Division Algorithm|divided]] by $n$. We define addition and multiplication in this [[Ring|ring]] by setting $[a] + [b] = [(a + b) \mod n]$ and $[a] \cdot  [b] = [ab \mod n]$. 

#### $\defn$ – $\Z[i]/(\beta)$
For $\beta \in\Z[i]$[^1], we define the [[Ring|ring]] $\Z[i]/(\beta )$ to be the set of [[Equivalence Class|equivalence classes]] of the mod-$\beta$ congruence relation on $\Z[i]$.
