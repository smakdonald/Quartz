#### $\defn$ – p-Adic Number
For a prime $p \in\N$, a $p$-adic (rational) number is an expression of the form 
$$\a = a_{-k} p^{-k} + a_{-k+1} p^{-k+1} + \cdots + a_{-1} p^{-1} + a_{0} + a_{1} p + a_{2} p^{2} + \cdots,$$
where $k \in\Z$ and each $a_{i}$ is an integer with $0 \leq a_{i} \leq p - 1$. 

#### $\defn$ – $\Q_{p}$ and $\Z_{p}$
The collection of $p$-adic rational numbers is denoted $\Q_{p}$. The $p$-adic integers, $\Z_{p}$, consist of those $p$-adic numbers with $a_{i} = 0$ for all $i < 0$, that is, a $p$-adic number with no negative powers of $p$ appearing.
