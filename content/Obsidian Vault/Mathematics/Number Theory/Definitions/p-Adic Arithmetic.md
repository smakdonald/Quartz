#### $\defn$ â€“ p-Adic Arithmetic
For $\a, \beta \in\Z_{p}$, we define $p$-adic *addition* and *multiplication* by 
$$\a + \beta = \lim_{n\to\infty} \a n + \beta n\quad \text{ and }\quad \a \cdot \beta = \lim_{n\to\infty} \a n \cdot \beta n.$$
For $p$-adic rationals $\a, \beta \in\Q_{p}$, we can bootstrap the definition of $p$-adic integer addition by factoring out appropriate powers of $p$: If $\a = p^{k}\a'$ and $\beta = p^{\ell}\beta'$ with $\a , \beta\in\Z_{p}$ and without loss of generality $k \geq \ell$, then 
$$\a\beta=p^{k+\ell}(\a'\beta')\quad\text{ and }\quad\a+\beta=p^{k}\a'+p^{\ell}\beta'=p^{\ell}(p^{k-\ell}\a'+\beta'),$$
where both concluding terms in parentheses are operations in $\Z_{p}$ and hence 
defined above.
