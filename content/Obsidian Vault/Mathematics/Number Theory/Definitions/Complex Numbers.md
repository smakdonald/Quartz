#### $\defn$ â€“ Complex Numbers
$\C = \{a + bi | a, b \in\R\}$[^1], where $i =\sqrt{-1}$, the [[Set|set]] of *complex numbers*. We will talk further about this mysterious entity $i$ shortly. Note that, among other things, the complex numbers are closed under taking square roots, whereas the [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] are not.
