#### $\defn$ – Gaussian Integers
The [[Set|set]] of *Gaussian integers*, denoted $\Z[i]$, consists of the numbers of the form $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are [[Integers|integers]]:  $$\Z[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in\Z, i^{2} = -1\}.$$Analogously, the *Gaussian rationals*, are the set[^1] $$\Q[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in\Q, i^{2} = -1\}.$$  
Finally, taking $a$ and $b$ from $\R$[^2], we get what in principle could be called the “Gaussian reals” but is instead called the set of [[Complex Numbers]], denoted $\C$:  
$$\C = \R[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in\R, i^{2} = -1\}.$$
