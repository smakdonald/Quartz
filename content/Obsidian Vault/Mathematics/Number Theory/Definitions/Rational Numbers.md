#### $\defn$ – Rational Numbers
$\Q = \{ \frac{a}{b} | a, b \in\Z, b \neq 0\}$[^1], the [[Set|set]] of *rational numbers*, or “the rationals,” as their friends call them. Note that the rationals are closed under (non-zero) division, whereas the integers are not.

#### $\defn$ – Rational Number
Let $x$ be a real number. The number $x$ is a *rational* number if there exist integers $n$ and $m$ such that $m\neq0$ and $x = \frac{n}{m}$. If $x$ is not a rational number, it is an *irrational* number.
