#### $\defn$ â€“ Base Expansion
The *base $p$ expansion* of a [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Definitions/Natural Numbers|natural number]] $n$ is the unique (Exercise 8.21) way 
of writing $n$ in the form 
$$n = a_{0} + a_{1} p + a_{2} p^{2} + \cdots + a_{k} p^{k}$$
for [[Integers|integer]] coefficients $a_{i}$ with $0 \leq a_{i} < p$.
