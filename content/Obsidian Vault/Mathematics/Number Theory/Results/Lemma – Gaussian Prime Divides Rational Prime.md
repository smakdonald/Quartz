#### $\lem$ â€“ Gaussian Prime Divides Rational Prime
If $\a \in\Z[i]$ is a Gaussian prime, then $\a$ divides some rational prime $p$.

##### *Proof.*
Write \a = a + bi. Then 
\a | (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^{2} + b^{2}. 
By unique factorization in Z, a^{2} +b^{2} can be factored into a product of rational primes 
p1 p2 \cdots pr. By the Gaussian Prime Divisor Property, \a must divide one of these 
rational prime factors.
