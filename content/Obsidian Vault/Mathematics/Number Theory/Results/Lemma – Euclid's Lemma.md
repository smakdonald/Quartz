#### $\lem$ – Euclid's Lemma
For [[Integers|integers]] $a, b$, and $c$, if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$[^1] and $a | bc$[^2], then $a | c$.

##### *Proof.*
Given integers $a$, b with \gcd(a, b) = 1, we know by Bézout’s Identity (The-  
orem 3.2.18) that there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Thus,  
cax + cby = c. Since a clearly divides ca, if a | cb as well, then by the Linear  
Combination Lemma, a | c.
