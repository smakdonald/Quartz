#### $\lem$ – Norm and Divisors
If $d = ab$ is non-zero and $a$ is not a unit, then $N (b) < N (d)$.

##### *Proof.*
Dividing b by d, there exist q, r \in\R such that b = dq + r and r = 0 or 
N (r ) < N (d). If r = 0, we find b = dq = (ab)q =⇒ aq = 1, contradicting the 
assumption that a is not a unit. Thus r  = 0, and N (r ) < N (d). Now b = dq + r, so 
b = abq + r. Thus b | r (by the Linear Combination Lemma), so N (b) \leq N (r ) < 
N (d), again as desired.
