#### $\cor$ – $\Z/(n)$ and Fields
For a [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Definitions/Natural Numbers|natural number]] $n > 1$, the following statements are equivalent:
(a) $n$ is [[Prime|prime]].
(b) $\Z/(n)$[^1] is a [[Field|field]].
(c) $\Z/(n)$ is an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]].

##### *Proof.*
The implication (i) =⇒ (ii) is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.4.3: if n is  
prime, any non-zero [a] \in\Z/(n) is represented by an integer a, 1 \leq  a < n, which is  
necessarily relatively prime to n, and so is a unit. The implication (ii) =⇒ (iii) follows  
for any ring (Lemma 3.1.11), and for (iii) =⇒ (i), proceeding via the contrapositive,  
if n were not prime, then n = ab for some a, b < n, and so [a][b] = 0 \in\Z/(n).
