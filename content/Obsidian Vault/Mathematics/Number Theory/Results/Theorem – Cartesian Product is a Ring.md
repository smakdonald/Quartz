#### $\thm$ â€“ Cartesian Product is a Ring
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Ring|rings]], with [[Binary Operation|operations]] $+$ and $\cdot$ . The [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian product]] $A\times B =  \{(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\}$ is also a ring with the component-wise defined operations  
$$(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$$  
$$(a, b) \cdot  (c, d) = (a \cdot  c, b \cdot  d),$$  
where the operations within first and second entries are the respective operations of the rings $A$ and $B$

##### *Proof.*
Almost all properties follow from A and B themselves being rings. For ex-  
ample, the additive identity of A \times B is (0A, 0B ) where 0A is the additive identity  
of A and 0B is the additive identity of B. We leave the details to Exercise 4.38.
