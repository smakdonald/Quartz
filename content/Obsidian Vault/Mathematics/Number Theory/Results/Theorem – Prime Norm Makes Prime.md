#### $\thm$ â€“ Prime Norm Makes Prime
Let $\pi \in\Z[i]$[^1]. If $N (\pi)$ is [[Prime|prime]] in $\Z$, then $\pi$ is prime in $\Z[i]$.

##### *Proof.*
Let \pi be an arbitrary Gaussian integer such that N (\pi) is a rational prime p, 
and suppose \a | \pi. Then \pi = \a \beta for some \beta \in\Z[i], and taking norms of both 
sides gives N (\a )N (\beta ) = N (\pi) = p. Now since p is prime in Z, one of N (\a ) or 
N (\beta ) must equal p, and the other must equal 1. Thus \a is either a unit or associate 
of \pi, and since \a was an arbitrary divisor of \pi, we conclude that \pi is a Gaussian 
prime.
