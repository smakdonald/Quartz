#### $\thm$ – Euler's Theorem
For all $n \in\N$[^1] and $a \in\Z$[^2] with $\gcd(a, n) = 1$[^3], we have $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$[^4].

##### *Proof.*
The hypotheses imply that [a] \in\Z/(n)\times. In this group we have |[a]| = |[a]|  
by Corollary 4.6.5, and so by Lagrange’s Theorem, |[a]| divides |\Z/(n)\times | = \varphi(n).  
Write \varphi(n) = |[a]|k for some k \in\Z, and now  
[a]\varphi(n) = ([a] |[a]|)k = [1]k = [1],  
as desired.
