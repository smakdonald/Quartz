#### $\lem$ â€“ Fields are Integral Domains
Every [[Field|field]] is an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]], but not every integral domain is a field.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose $R$ is a field, and that $a, b \in R$ satisfy $ab = 0$. We need to show that either a or b is zero, i.e., that if $a  = 0$, then $b = 0$. If $a=0$, then since $R$ is a field, there exists $a-1 \in \R$, and so $b = (a-1a)b = a-1(ab) = a-1 \cdot  0 = 0$.
