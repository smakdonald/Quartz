#### $\cor$ â€“ Relatively Prime Int and Gauss
If $a, b \in\Z$ have $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ in $\Z$, then we have $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ in $\Z[i]$ as well.

##### *Proof.*
Given Gaussian integers \a, \beta and \g, if \a and \beta are relatively prime and \a | \beta \g, 
then \a | \g.
If am + bn = 1 in Z, then am + bn = 1 in \Z[i], too!
