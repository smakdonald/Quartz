#### $\lem$ â€“ Norms and Units
Let $R$ be the ring of integers of $\Q[\sqrt{d}]$. Then for all $\mu \in R$, $\mu$ is a unit in $R$ if and 
only if $N (\mu )$ is a unit in $\Z$. That is, $\mu \in R^{\times} \Longleftrightarrow N (\mu ) \in\Z^{\times}$.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose \mu \in\R is a unit. Then there exists \nu \in\R such that \mu \nu = 1. Then by 
Lemma 6.3.6, 
1 = N (1) = N (\mu \nu) = N (\mu )N ( \nu), and since N (\mu ) and N ( \nu) are integers that multiply to 1, we see they must be units. 
Conversely, if N (\mu ) is a unit, then N (u) = \mu \mu = \pm1, so either \mu or -\mu is a 
multiplicative inverse of \mu in R. (Note that from the explicit form given in Theorem 
6.3.5, \mu is an algebraic integer if and only if \mu is.)
