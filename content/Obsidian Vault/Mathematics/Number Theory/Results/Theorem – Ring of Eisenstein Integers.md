#### $\thm$ – Ring of Eisenstein Integers
Under the complex norm, the ring of Eisenstein integers $\Z\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\right]$ is a Euclidean Domain and hence a UFD.

##### *Proof.*
Let \a, \beta \in\Z[\g ] with \beta  = 0. We need to show that we can 
write 
\a = \chi \beta + \rho 
with N (\rho ) < N (\beta ). As with our previous geometric proofs, we need only argue 
that every element \a \in\Z[\g ] is sufficiently close to a lattice point. Subdividing 
the fundamental domain using the diagonal from \beta to \g \beta results in two equilateral 
triangles with side length √N (\beta ), and any \a must be in one of the two triangles. 
Elementary geometry shows that the center of an equilateral triangle with side 
length √N (\beta ) is within 
√3N (\beta ) 
4 of a vertex (Figure 6.5), which is less than √N (\beta ). 
Thus any point in the plane, and in particular any lattice point \a, is within √N (\beta ) of 
a multiple of \beta. In our standard arithmetic language, this says that the remainder \rho 
(the difference between \a and the nearest multiple \chi \beta of \beta ) has norm N (\rho ) < N (\beta ).
