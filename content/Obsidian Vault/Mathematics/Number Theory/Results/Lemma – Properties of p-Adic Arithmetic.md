#### $\lem$ – Properties of p-Adic Arithmetic
For $\a, \beta \in\Q_{p}$, and $n \in\N$, we have
(a) $v_{p}(\a \beta ) = v_{p}(\a ) + v_{p}(\beta )$.
(b) $v_{p}(\a^{n}) = nv_{p}(\a)$.
(c) $v_{p}(\a + \beta ) \geq \min\{v_{p}(\a ), v_{p}(\beta )\}$.

##### *Proof.*
First assume that \a, \beta  = 0. Write \a = p k \a  and b = p\beta  as in (8.2). Then 
\a \beta  \mod p  = 0 since both \a , \beta   \equiv 0 \mod p, and so 
vp(\a \beta ) = vp( p k+l \a \beta ) = k +  = v_{p}(a) + v_{p}(b). 
The second bullet follows from the first by induction. For the final part, let’s assume 
without loss of generality that k \geq . Then  = min{vp(\a ), vp(\beta )} and 
vp(\a + \beta ) = vp( p k \a  + p\beta ) = vp( p ( p k-\a  + \beta )) \geq . 
When \a = 0, we can see that the convention from Definition 8.2.6 that vp(0) = \infty 
was hand-picked to make these three properties hold. We leave the details for Exercise 
8.30.
