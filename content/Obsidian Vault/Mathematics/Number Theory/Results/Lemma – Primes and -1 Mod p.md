#### $\lem$ – Primes and -1 Mod p
If $p$ is a prime such that $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$, then $x^{2} \equiv -1 \mod p$ has no solutions

##### *Proof.*
By way of contradiction, suppose there exists an x \in\Z such that x^{2} \equiv -1 
(\mod p) for some prime p of the form 4n + 3. Raising both sides to the power 2n + 1 
gives 
-1 \equiv (-1)2n+1 \equiv (x^{2})2n+1 \equiv x4n+2 \equiv x p-1 (\mod p), 
which contradicts Fermat’s Little Theorem.
