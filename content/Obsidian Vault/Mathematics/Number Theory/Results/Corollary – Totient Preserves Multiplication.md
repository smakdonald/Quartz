#### $\cor$ – Totient Preserves Multiplication
Suppose $\gcd(m, n) = 1$[^1]. Then an element $[x] \in\Z/(mn)$[^2] is a [[Unit|unit]] if and only if  
$x \mod m$[^3] and $x \mod n$ are units $\mod m$ and $n$, respectively. That is, the [[Bijective|bijection]] of [[Theorem – Sunzi's Remainder Theorem|Sunzi’s Remainder Theorem]] also provides a bijection from $\Z/(mn)^{\times}$[^4] to $\Z/(m)^{\times}\times\Z/(n)^{\times}$. Consequently, we have $\varphi(mn) = \varphi(m)\varphi(n)$.
