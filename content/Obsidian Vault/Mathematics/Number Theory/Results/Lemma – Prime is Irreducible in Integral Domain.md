#### $\lem$ â€“ Prime is Irreducible in Integral Domain
In any integral domain, every prime element is irreducible.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose that p is a prime element of the integral domain R, and suppose that 
p = ab for some a, b \in\R. Then p | ab, so p | a or p | b by the definition of 
prime. Without loss of generality, suppose p | a, so a = pc for some c \in\R. Now 
p = ab = pcb, so p(1 - cb) = 0 and since R is an integral domain, this implies 
that 1 = cb, proving that b is a unit.
