#### $\thm$ â€“ Wilson's Theorem
Let $p$ be a [[Prime|prime]] number. Then $( p - 1)! \equiv -1 (\mod p)$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
By Lemma 4.4.9 and Corollary 4.4.5, every element in the product  
( p - 1)! \equiv 1 \cdot  2 \cdot  3 \cdots  ( p - 1) \mod p  
has a multiplicative inverse that also appears elsewhere in the product except for 1  
and ( p - 1), which are their own inverses. Thus, the factors cancel in pairs with their  
inverses and we are left with 1 \cdot  ( p - 1) \equiv -1 (\mod p).
