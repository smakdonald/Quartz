#### $\cor$ â€“ Properties of GCD
For $a, b \in\Z$[^1], we have the identities $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a)$[^2] and $\gcd(a, b) =\gcd(a, b - a)$.

##### *Proof.*
The first is clear from the definition, and the second follows from the lemma as every common divisor of a and b is also a common divisor of a and $b - a$, and, conversely, a common divisor of $a$ and $b - a$ is also a common divisor of $a$ and $(b - a) + a = b$. Thus, the two pairs have exactly the same common divisors, so in particular, they share the same greatest common divisor.
