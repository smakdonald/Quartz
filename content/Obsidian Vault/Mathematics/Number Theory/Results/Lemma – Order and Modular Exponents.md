#### $\lem$ â€“ Order and Modular Exponents
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and let $g \in G$. If $g^{b} = 1$ for some positive [[Integers|integer]] $b$, then for  
any integer $k$ we have $g^{k} = g^{k\mod b}$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
By the Division Algorithm we can write k = bq + r with 0 \leq  r < b; thus  
r = k \mod b. Then  
gk = gbq+r = (gb)q \cdot  gr = 1q \cdot  gr = gk \mod b,  
as desired.
