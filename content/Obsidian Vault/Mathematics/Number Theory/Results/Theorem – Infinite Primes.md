#### $\thm$ â€“ Infinite Primes
There are infinitely many [[Prime|primes]].

##### *Proof.*
We will show that given any finite set of primes, { p1, \dots  , p k }, we can always  
find another prime p not in the set. To do this, consider the number  
N = p1 p2 \cdots  p k + 1,  
and let p be the smallest prime divisor of N . Then none of the pi divide N (by its  
form above, we can see that the remainder when N is divided by any of the pi is 1)  
but p does, so p is distinct from each of the primes pi in the initial set. We conclude  
that no finite set of primes can contain them all.
