#### $\lem$ – Composite Numbers and Prime Divisors
Every [[Prime|composite]] $n \in\N$[^1] has a [[Prime|prime]] [[Divides|divisor]] $p$ with $p \leq\sqrt{n}$.

##### *Proof.*
Since n is composite, we can write n = ab with a, b > 1. Now we couldn’t  
have both a, b > √n, as this would imply ab > √n \cdot  √n = n. Choose p to be any  
prime divisor of whichever factor is at most √n.
