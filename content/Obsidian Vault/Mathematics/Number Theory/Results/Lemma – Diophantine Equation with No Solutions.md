#### $\lem$ â€“ Diophantine Equation with No Solutions
The [[Diophantine Equation|Diophantine equation]] $a^{2} + b^{2} = n$ has no solutions if $n \equiv 3 (\mod 4)$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
We consider the possible values of a^{2} + b^{2} \mod 4, which in turn are con-  
strained by the possible value of any square \mod 4. We compute  
[0]2 = [0] [1]2 = [1] [2]2 = [0] [3]2 = [1],  
which shows, since any integer is in one of those four congruence classes, that  
any integer squared is congruent to either 0 or 1 \mod 4. Thus, since a^{2} \mod 4 and  
b^{2} \mod 4 are both either 0 or 1, it could not be that a^{2} + b^{2} \equiv 3 \mod 4.
