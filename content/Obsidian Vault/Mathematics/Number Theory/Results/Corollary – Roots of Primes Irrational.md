#### $\cor$ – Roots of Primes Irrational
If $p$ is [[Prime|prime]], then $\sqrt{p}$ is [[Rational Numbers|irrational]].

##### *Proof.*
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that √ p = a  
b with \gcd(a, b) = 1. Then  
pb^{2} = a^{2} , so p | a^{2} , and thus p | a by the previous corollary. Write a = pc for  
some c \in\Z and substitute to get pb^{2} = p2c^{2} , which gives b^{2} = pc^{2} . From this,  
we conclude that p | b^{2} , so p | b. But now p is a common divisor of a and b,  
contradicting that \gcd(a, b) = 1.
