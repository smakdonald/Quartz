#### $\lem$ â€“ Valuation of Products
For non-zero [[Integers|integers]] $a$ and $b$, we have  
$v_{p}(ab) = v_{p}(a) + v_{p}(b)$[^1].

##### *Proof.*
Let k = v_{p}(a) and  = v_{p}(b) so we can write a = p k a and b = pb with  
p  a and p  b . Then ab = p k+a b , and by the contrapositive of the Prime  
Divisor Lemma, p  a b , so vp(ab) = k +  = v_{p}(a) + v_{p}(b).
