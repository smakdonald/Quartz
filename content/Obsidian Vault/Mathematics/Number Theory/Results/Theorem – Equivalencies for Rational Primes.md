#### $\thm$ – Equivalencies for Rational Primes
The following are equivalent for all rational primes $p$:
(a) $p \equiv 1$ or $2 \mod 4$;
(b) $p= a^{2} + b^{2}$ for some unique $a, b \in\Z$ (up to sign and order);
(c) $\sqrt{-1} \in\Z/( p)$;
(d) $p$ factors in $\Z[i]$, i.e., $p$ is not a Gaussian prime.

#### $\thm$ – Equivalencies for Rational Primes
The following are equivalent for all rational primes $p$:
(a) $p = \pm(a^{2} - 2b^{2})$
(b) $p$ factors in $Z[\sqrt{2}]$, i.e., $p$ is not prime in $Z[\sqrt{2}]$
(c) $2$ is a square$\mod p$
(d) $p \equiv \pm1 \mod 8$
