#### $\lem$ â€“ Norm of 0 is a Unit
Let $R$ be a Euclidean domain with Euclidean norm $N$ and $a\neq 0 \in R$. If $N (a)=0$, then $a \in\R^{\times}$.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose that N (a) = 0. Then applying the Division Algorithm to divide 1 
by a, we find q, r \in\R such that 1 = aq + r with r = 0 or N (r ) < N (a). Since 
N (a) = 0, it must be the case that r = 0, so aq = 1, and thus a is a unit.
