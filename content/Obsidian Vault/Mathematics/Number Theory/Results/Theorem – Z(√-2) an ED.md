#### $\thm$ – Z(√-2) an ED
The complex norm N (a + b√-2) = a^{2} + 2b^{2} on Z[√-2] is a Euclidean 
norm, so Z[√-2] is a Euclidean domain, and hence a UFD.

##### *Proof.*
From Definition 6.4.1, we have two things to check. First is that whenever 
\a | \beta, we must have N (\a ) \leq N (\beta ), but this is an immediate consequence of Lemma 
6.3.6, as N (\a ) and N (\beta ) are positive integers with N (\a ) | N (\beta ). 
The second thing to check is the Division Algorithm: for all \a, \beta \in\Z[√-2], 
there exist \chi, \rho \in\Z[√-2], with 0 \leq N (\rho ) < N (\beta ), such that \a = \chi \beta + \rho. The 
lattice reduces this to a geometric argument: given a rectangle of side lengths √N 
and √2N units, no point in the interior is farther than 
√3N 
2 (the length of half a 
diagonal) away from one of the vertices. Applying this to the fundamental domain generated by \beta, this says that every number \a \in\Z[√-2] is within 
√3N (\beta ) 
2 of some 
multiple \chi \beta of \beta. Thus, if we let \rho = \a - \chi \beta, then since the norm is the square 
of the distance, N (\rho ) \leq 3 
4 N (\beta ) < N (\beta ), showing that our norm N satisfies both 
conditions required to be a Euclidean norm.
