#### $\lem$ â€“ Norm and Units
If $u$ is a unit of $R$, then $N (u) = N (1)$. If $d$ is a non-zero non-unit of $R$, then 
$N (d) > N (1)$.

##### *Proof.*
Let u be a unit of R, so uv = 1 for some v \in\R. Then u | 1, so N (u) \leq N (1). 
Of course, 1 | u as well, so N (1) \leq N (u), and thus N (u) = N (1). Now let d be a 
non-zero non-unit of R, and divide 1 by it: there exist q, r \in\R such that 1 = dq + r, 
where r = 0 or N (r ) < N (d). Since d is not a unit, r  = 0, so we must have 
N (r ) < N (d). But as 1 | r, N (1) \leq N (r ) < N (d), as desired.
