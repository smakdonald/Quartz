#### $\lem$ â€“ Linear Combination Lemma
Suppose $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ $(a, b, d \in \Z)$[^1]. Then $d | (ax + by)$[^2] for all $x, y \in \Z$.

##### *Proof.*
Since $d | a$ and $d | b$, we can write $a = dm$ and $b = dn$ for some $m, n \in\Z$. Substituting, we find $ax + by = dmx + dny = d(mx + ny)$, and thus $ax + by$ is an integral multiple of d.
