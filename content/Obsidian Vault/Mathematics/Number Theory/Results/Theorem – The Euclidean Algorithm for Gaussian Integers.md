#### $\thm$ â€“ The Euclidean Algorithm for Gaussian Integers
For all $\a, \beta \in\Z[i]$, $\beta\neq 0$, set $\rho_{-1} = \a$ and $\rho_{0} = \beta$. For each $j \geq 0$, recursively define $\rho_{j+1} = \rho_{j-1} \mod{\rho_{j}}$, a remainder as given by the Gaussian Division Algorithm. Then for some $n \geq 1$ the process terminates with $\rho_{n} = 0$ and $\rho_{n-1}$ equal to a greatest common divisor of $\a$ and $\beta$.
