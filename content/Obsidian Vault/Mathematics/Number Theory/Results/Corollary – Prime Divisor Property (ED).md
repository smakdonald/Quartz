#### $\cor$ – Prime Divisor Property (ED)
In a Euclidean domain $R$, every irreducible element is prime.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose p is irreducible and p | bc for some b, c \in\R. If p | b, we’re done, 
so suppose p  b. A common divisor of p and b cannot then be an associate of p, 
so since p is irreducible, must be a unit, giving \gcd( p, b) = 1. By Euclid’s Lemma 
above, p | c, showing that p is prime.
