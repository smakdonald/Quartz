#### $\thm$ â€“ Mod-$n$ Root Test
If a [[Diophantine Equation|Diophantine equation]] has a solution in $\Z$[^1], then it has a solution in $\Z/(n)$[^2]  
for each $n \in\N$[^3]. The contrapositive is even more striking: if there exists even  
one $n \in\N$ for which the [[Modular Reduction|reduced equation]] has no solution in $\Z/(n)$, then the  
equation has no [[Integers|integer]] solutions.
