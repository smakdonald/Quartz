#### $\lem$ â€“ Valuations, GCD, LCM
For each [[Prime|prime]] $p$ we have $v_{p} (\gcd(a, b)) = \min\{v_{p} (a), v_{p} (b)\}$[^1] and $v_{p} (\lcm(a, b)) = \max\{v_{p} (a), v_{p} (b)\}.$[^2] In particular, $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if and only if for each prime $p$, either $v_{p}(a) = 0$ or $v_{p}(b) = 0$ (or both).
