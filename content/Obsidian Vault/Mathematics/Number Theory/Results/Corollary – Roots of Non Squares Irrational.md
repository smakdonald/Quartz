#### $\cor$ – Roots of Non Squares Irrational
If a [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Definitions/Natural Numbers|natural number]] $n$ is not a square, then $\sqrt{n}$ is [[Rational Numbers|irrational]].

##### *Proof.*
Since n is not a square, there exists a prime p | n such that v_{p}(n) is odd.  
Now suppose √n = a  
b were rational. Then nb^{2} = a^{2} , but vp(a^{2}) = 2v_{p}(a) is even,  
whereas vp(nb^{2}) = v_{p}(n) + 2v_{p}(b) is odd, giving a contradiction.
