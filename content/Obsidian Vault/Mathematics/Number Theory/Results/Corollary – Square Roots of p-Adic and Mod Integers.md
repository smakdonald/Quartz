#### $\cor$ – Square Roots of p-Adic and Mod Integers
Suppose $p$ is an odd prime, and let $\beta \in\Z^{\times}_{p}$. Then $\beta$ has a square root in $Z_{p}$ if and only if $\beta \mod p$ has a square root in $\Z/( p)$.

##### *Proof.*
One direction is clear by looking at constant terms. If \a 2 = \beta in Zp, then 
their leading coefficients satisfy a^{2} 
0 \equiv b0 (\mod p). The converse is Hensel’s Lemma
