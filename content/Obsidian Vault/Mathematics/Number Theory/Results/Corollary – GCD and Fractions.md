#### $\cor$ â€“ GCD and Fractions
Suppose $g = \gcd(a, b)\neq 0$[^1]. Then $\frac{a}{g}$ and $\frac{b}{g}$ are relatively prime [[Integers|integers]].

##### *Proof.*
Since g | a and g | b, both a  
g and b  
g are integers. To check that they  
are relatively prime, we observe that by Corollary 3.2.15, we have  
g \gcd  
( a  
g , b  
g  
)  
= \gcd (a, b) = g,  
and so dividing by g shows that a  
g and b  
g have a \gcd of 1.
