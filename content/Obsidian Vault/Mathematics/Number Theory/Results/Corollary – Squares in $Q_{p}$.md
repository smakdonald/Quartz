#### $\cor$ â€“ Squares in $\Q_{p}$
Suppose $\a \in\Q_{p}$ is written in the form 
$$\a = p^{v_{p}(\a)}u \quad (u \in\Z^{\times}_{p}).$$
- For $p$ odd, $\a$ is a square in $\Q_{p}$ if and only if $v_{p}(\a )$ is even and $\left(\frac{u\mod p}{p}\right) = 1$
- For $p = 2$, $\a$ is a square in $\Q_{p}$ if and only if $v_{p}(\a)$ is even and $u \equiv 1 \mod 8$.

##### *Proof.*
If vp(\a ) is odd, \a has no square roots by valuation considerations. If vp(\a ) 
is even, then pvp (\a ) has the obvious square root pvp (\a )/2 so \a has a square root if 
and only if u does.
