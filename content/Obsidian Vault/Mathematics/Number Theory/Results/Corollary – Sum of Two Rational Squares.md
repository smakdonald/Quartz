#### $\cor$ â€“ Sum of Two Rational Squares
An integer $n$ can be written as a sum of two rational squares if and only if $v_{p}(n)$ 
is even for every prime $p \equiv 3 \mod 4$.

##### *Proof.*
We show that n is a sum of integer squares if and only if it is a sum of rational 
squares, after which Theorem 5.7.1 provides the result.

As a sum of integer squares is evidently a sum of rational squares, one direction 
is immediately covered by the theorem. It remains to show that any number that can 
be written as a sum of rational squares is also a sum of integer squares, so suppose 
n = ( a 
b 
)2 + ( c 
d 
)2. Clearing denominators gives the equality of integers 
nb^{2}d2 = (ad)2 + (bc)2. 
Now since nb^{2}d2 is a sum of integer squares, for any q \equiv 3 \mod 4 we must have 
vq (nb^{2}d2) = vq (n) + 2vq (b) + 2vq (d) 
is even, and hence vq (n) is even. Thus n is a sum of two squares.
