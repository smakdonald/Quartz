#### $\cor$ – Fermat's Little Theorem
For $p$ [[Prime|prime]], if $\gcd(a, p) = 1$[^1], then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 (\mod p)$[^2]. For all $a \in\Z$[^3], $a^{p} \equiv a \mod p$.

##### *Proof.*
The first claim is a special case of Euler’s Theorem with \varphi( p) = p - 1.  
Multiplying both sides by a gives a p \equiv a \mod p, and this identity holds for a \equiv  
0 \mod p as well.
