#### $\lem$ – Gaussian Power Lemma
Let $\a$ and $\beta$ be relatively prime Gaussian integers. If $\a \beta$ is an $n\th$ power in $\Z[i]$, 
then $\a$ and $\beta$ are themselves $n\th$ powers (up to units) in $\Z[i]$. If n is odd, then $\a$ 
and $\beta$ are themselves $n\th$ powers in $\Z[i]$.

##### *Proof.*
If \a \beta is an n-th power, then 
\a \beta = (ε\pia1 
1 \cdots \pia k 
k )n = εn \pina1 
1 \pina^{2} 
2 \cdots \pina k 
k, 
where ε \in\Z[i]\times = {\pm1, \pmi} and each \pi j is a Gaussian prime. Given our assumption 
that \a and \beta are relatively prime, each \pina j 
j divides either \a or \beta but not both. Thus 
\a and \beta take the form \a = ε1\pina j1 
j1 \cdots \pina jl 
jl and \beta = ε2\pina k1 
k1 \cdots \pina km 
k m, where 
ε1, ε2 \in\Z[i] \times. Thus \a and \beta are n-th powers up to units. When n is odd, each unit 
of \Z[i] is itself an n-th power in \Z[i], so we can drop the “up to units” clause.
