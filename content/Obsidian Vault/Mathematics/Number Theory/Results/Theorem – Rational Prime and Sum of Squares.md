#### $\thm$ â€“ Rational Prime and Sum of Squares
The rational prime $p \in\Z$ is a Gaussian prime if and only if $p= a^{2} + b^{2}$ for all $a,b\in\Z$.

##### *Proof.*
Suppose p \in\Z is not the sum of two squares, and suppose that \a is a divisor 
of p in \Z[i]. Then taking norms, we see N (\a ) | N ( p) = p2, so N (\a ) = 1, p, or p2. 
We show the middle case is impossible: if N (\a ) = p then writing \a = a + bi shows 
that a^{2} +b^{2} = p, contradicting our assumption that p could not be written as a sum of 
squares. Thus, it must be the case that N (\a ) = 1 or p2. This shows that an arbitrary 
divisor \a of p is either a unit or an associate of p in \Z[i], and thus p is by definition 
a Gaussian prime. Finally, for the converse, if p = a^{2} + b^{2} = (a + bi)(a - bi), then 
a + bi is a divisor of p with norm p and thus is neither a unit nor an associate of p, 
so p is not prime.
