#### $\lem$ â€“ Valuation and Square Numbers
A [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Definitions/Natural Numbers|natural number]] $n$ is a square if and only if $v_{p}(n)$[^1] is even for all [[Prime|primes]] $p$.

##### *Proof.*
If n = k2 , then for any prime p, we have by Lemma 3.4.4  
v_{p}(n) = vp(k2) = vp(k) + vp(k) = 2vp(k)  
which is even. Conversely, if each exponent in the prime factorization of n is even,  
then we can write  
n = p2a1  
1 p2a^{2}  
2 \cdots  p2a k  
k ,  
and so evidently n = k2 for k = p a1  
1 p a^{2}  
2 \cdots  p a k  
k .
