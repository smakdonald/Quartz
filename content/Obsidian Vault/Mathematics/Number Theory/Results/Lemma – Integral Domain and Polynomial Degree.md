#### $\lem$ â€“ Integral Domain and Polynomial Degree
If $R$ is an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]], then for non-zero polynomials $f, g \in R[x]$[^1], we have the standard [[Polynomial Degree|degree]] fact $\deg( f g) = \deg( f ) + \deg(g)$.

##### *Proof.*
If $f = a_{n} x^{n} + \cdots  + a_{0}$ and $g = b m x m + \cdots  + b0$ with $a_{i}$ , $b_{i} \in R$, then  $f g = a n bm x n+m + \cdots  + a0b0$.  
This is a polynomial of degree $m + n$ since $a n bm  = 0$ by virtue of the fact that $R$ is an integral domain.
