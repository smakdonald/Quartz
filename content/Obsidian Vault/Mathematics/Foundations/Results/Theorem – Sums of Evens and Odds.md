#### $\thm$ â€“ Sums of Evens and Odds
Let $n$ and $m$ be integers.
(a) If $n$ and $m$ are both [[Even and Odd|even]], then $n + m$ is even.
(b) If $n$ and $m$ are both [[Even and Odd|odd]], then $n + m$ is even.
(c) If $n$ is even and $m$ is odd, then $n + m$ is odd.

##### *Proof.*
Let $n$ and $m$ be integers.
###### Part (a)
Suppose $n$ and $m$ are even. Thus $n=2k$ and $m=2j$ for some integers $k,j$, respectively. Thus we can write $$
n+m=2k+2j=2(k+j).$$As $k+j$ is itself an integer, we see that $n+m$ is even.
###### Part (b)
Suppose $n$ and $m$ are odd. Thus $n=2k+1$ and $m=2j+1$ for some integers $k,j$, respectively. Thus we can write $$
n+m=(2k+1)+(2j+1)=2(k+j+1).$$As $k+j+1$ is itself an integer, we see that $n+m$ is even 
###### Part (c)
Suppose $n$ is even and $m$ is odd. Thus $n=2k$ and $m=2j+1$ for some integers $k,j$, respectively. Thus we can write $$
n+m=2k+2j+1=2(k+j)+1.$$As $k+j$ is itself an integer, we see that $n+m$ is odd.
