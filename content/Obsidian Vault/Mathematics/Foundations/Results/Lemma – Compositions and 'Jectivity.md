#### $\lem$ – Compositions and 'Jectivity
Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be [[Set|sets]], and let $f : A → B$ and $g : B → C$ be [[Function|functions]].

(a) If $f$ and $g$ are [[Injective|injective]], then $g \circ f$[^1] is injective.
(b) If $f$ and $g$ are [[Surjective|surjective]], then $g \circ f$ is surjective.
(c) If $f$ and $g$ are [[Bijective|bijective]], then $g \circ f$ is bijective.
