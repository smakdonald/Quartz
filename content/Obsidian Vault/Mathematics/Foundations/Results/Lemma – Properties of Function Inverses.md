#### $\lem$ – Properties of Function Inverses
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Set|sets]], and let $f : A → B$ be a [[Function|function]].
(a) If $f$ has an [[Function Inverse|inverse]], then the inverse is unique.
(b) If $f$ has a [[Function Inverse|right inverse]] $g$ and a [[Function Inverse|left inverse]] $h$, then $g = h$, and hence $f$ has an inverse.
(c) If $g$ is an inverse of $f$, then $f$ is an inverse of $g$.
