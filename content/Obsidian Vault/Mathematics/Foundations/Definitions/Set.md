#### $\defn$ – Set
A *set* is a collection of objects, not necessarily mathematical ones. We denote sets using capital letters. For example, $S$ could be used to denote a set.

The term *set* is used (roughly) to describe any collection of objects. For example, the set whose objects are the positive integers 1, 2, 3 may be denoted $$\{1,2,3\}$$If a set consists of a finite number of objects, we may denote the set by listing its objects. If a set consists of infinitely many objects such a listing is impossible. In this case we may describe the set by naming a property common to all the objects in the set. For example, to describe the set of positive integers, we use the notation $$\{x \,|\,x \,\text{is a positive integer}\}$$This notation is read “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a positive integer.” (The bar “ | ” is read “such that.”) In general, to describe the set of all objects having a particular property $P$, we write $$\{x \,|\,x \,\text{has property}\,P\}$$
