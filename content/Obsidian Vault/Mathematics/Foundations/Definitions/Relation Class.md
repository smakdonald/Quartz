#### $\defn$ â€“ Relation Class
Let $A$ and $B$ be non-empty [[Set|sets]], let $R$ be a [[Mathematics/Foundations/Definitions/Relation|relation]] from $A$ to $B$, and let $x\in A$[^1]. The *relation class* of $x$ with respect to $R$, denoted $R[x]$, is the set defined by $$R[x]=\{y\in B|xRy\}.$$If the relation $R$ is understood from the context, we will often write $[x]$ instead of $R[x].$
