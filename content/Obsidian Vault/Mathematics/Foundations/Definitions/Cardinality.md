#### $\defn$ â€“ Cardinality
Let $A$ be a [[Set|set]]. Suppose that $A$ is [[Finite Set|finite]]. The *cardinality* of $A$, denoted $|A|$, is defined as follows. If $A = \es$, let $|A| = 0$. If $A\neq0$, let $|A| = n$, where $A\sim\{1,\dots, n\}$.

Now let $A$ and $B$ be sets, not necessarily finite. The sets $A$ and $B$ have the same *cardinality*, denoted $A\sim B$, if there is a [[Bijective|bijective]] [[Function|function]] $f : A \to B$.
