#### $\defn$ â€“ Pairwise Disjoint
Let $I$ be a non-empty [[Set|set]], and let $\{A_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ be a [[Family of Sets|family]] of sets [[Family of Sets|indexed]] by $I$. The family of sets $\{A_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ is *pairwise disjoint* if $i,j\in I$ and $i\neq j$ imply that  $A_{i}\cap A_{j} = \es.$[^1]
