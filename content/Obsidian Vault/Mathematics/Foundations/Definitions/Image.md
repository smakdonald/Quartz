#### $\defn$ â€“ Image
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Set|sets]], and let $f : A \to B$ be a [[Function|function]]. Let $P \sse A$[^1]. The *image* of $P$ under $f$, denoted $f (P)$, is the set defined by$$f(P)=\{b\in B|b=f(p)\text{ for some }p\in P\}.$$The $range$ of $f$ (also called the *image* of $f$) is the set $f(A)$.
